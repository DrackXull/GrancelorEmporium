# **ACT I — Quest 1: “The Price of Curiosity”**

**Level Range:** 1  
 **Playtime:** \~1–2 hours  
 **Tone:** Dark comedy, curiosity, claustrophobia, capitalist horror

---

## **🎬 Opening Setup**

*“The Emporium smells of dust, candlewax, and profit.”*  
 Players enter **Grancelor’s Arcane Emporium of Excess**, the continent’s most decadent magical store—a maze of gilded shelves, animated signage, and cursed bargains.

They may have come to:

1. Buy a rumored artifact they can’t afford.

2. Steal from the store on behalf of a patron.

3. “Browse” and inevitably break something.

The shop appears empty.  
 A self-writing **Ledger** floats at the counter, taking notes in glowing script. Every item hums faintly, as if watching.

**DM Tip:** Encourage players to *touch everything*. The faster they trigger the Lockdown, the funnier it is.

---

## **🧭 Room Layout — The Front Showroom**

    `[Glass Case]     [Free Sample Chest]`

          `|                   |`

 `[Shelf]--+------(60x60 marble floor)------+--[Mirror Wall]`

          `|                   |`

   `[Counter w/ Ledger]   [Armor Display]`

* **Ceiling:** Sprite-filled chandeliers (dim light, flickering).

* **Hazards:** Fire runes under rugs; animated signage (Arcane trap).

* **Room Size:** 60 × 60 ft, circular flow; exits seal during Lockdown.

---

## **⚙️ Core Mechanic: The Temptation Trigger**

When a player **casts Detect Magic**, **touches**, or **opens** *anything*:

**Alarm Response:**

* Iron shutters slam down (Dex Save DC 13 to avoid debris).

* Sigils flare red.

* A friendly PA voice:

   “Warning: Customer enthusiasm detected. Initiating loss-prevention protocol.”

* All exits seal; the Lockdown begins.

🎙 **Grancelor (over intercom):**

“Well well well… look who couldn’t resist the markdown rack.”

---

## **🪞 The Mirror of Futures Passed**

*Central puzzle \+ moral tutorial.*

A floor-to-ceiling mirror between chandeliers shows delayed reflections—each player’s reflection wears improved gear.  
 When **all** players look together, runes shimmer across the glass.

### **Puzzle Summary**

* **Goal:** Discover that unity (“acting together”) releases real loot.

* **Trap:** Acting alone spawns hostile reflections.

### **Mirror Trigger Table**

| Player Action | Mirror Reaction |
| ----- | ----- |
| One player grabs item | Reflection freezes and smiles; eyes glow red. |
| Two players grab different items | Cracks form; reflections whisper each other’s names backward. |
| All players mirror each other | Reflections nod; loot manifests. |
| Any attack/selfish act | Mirror fractures; reflections crawl out (combat). |

### **Puzzle Solution**

* All stand shoulder-to-shoulder.

* Each imitates their reflection’s stance or “item.”

* Mirror liquefies → Items appear (Uncommon gear, tailored).

* \+1 **Descent Mark** (Unity through Greed).

* **Failure:** triggers **Mirror Doppelganger Fight** (below).

---

## **⚔️ Encounter: Mirror Doppelgangers**

*(CR \= party level)*  
 Each player’s reflection manifests as a corrupted version of their path archetype.

| Path | AC | HP | Attack | Damage | Special |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Infernal Shade | 13 | 22 | Fiery Slash | 1d8+2 \+1d4 fire | Burns 5-ft radius |
| Arcane Projection | 11 | 16 | Arcane Bolt | 1d10 force | 1d6 splash on death |
| Syndicate Phantom | 14 | 18 | Dagger Flurry | 2×1d6+2 | Adv in dim light |
| Monstrous Husk | 13 | 26 | Bite/Claw | 1d6+3 | Regain 5 HP/turn |
| Iron Legion Remnant | 16 | 25 | Greatsword | 2d6+3 | Resist nonmagical |
| Abyssal Echo | 12 | 20 | Mind Claw | 1d8 psychic | Target loses reaction |

**Scanner Results:**

1. Vulnerable to thunder or force.

2. Immune to poison.

3. Possess “mirror resonance core.”

4. Reflection line echoes user’s name in reverse.

**Difficulty Scaling:**

* 2 players: 1 elite \+ 1 add.

* 4–5 players: all mirrors active simultaneously.

* 6+: 1 elite doppelganger spawns reinforcements every 2 rounds.

---

## **💬 Grancelor Commentary (During Fight/Puzzle)**

* “Unity through avarice\! My favorite team-building exercise.”

* “If your reflection starts talking first, don’t answer—that’s how lawsuits happen.”

* “Careful, reflections hold grudges longer than gods.”

---

## **🧠 Puzzle Outcomes**

| Result | Reward | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Solved cooperatively | True loot manifests (+1 Descent Mark). | Teaches team play. |
| Mirror shattered, enemies defeated | Cursed/lesser copies (+1 Dark Debt). | Foreshadows corruption. |
| Ignored | Mirror reappears in Act II (haunting callback). | “Regret detected.” |

**🎲 Trap Table — The Temptation Showcase**

* **Dark Debt:** \+1 if any theft/selfish trigger.

---

## **🗝️ Quest End & Hook**

When the Ledger finishes writing, it bursts into green flame and reforms as a holographic script:

“Clause recorded: ‘If found guilty of curiosity, one must earn reclassification as staff.’”

A new doorway materializes where the mirror stood:

“By entering, you agree to all terms, known and unknown.”

→ Leads to **Quest 2: “Terms & Conditions Apply.”**

---

## **🧾 DM Quick Summary Box**

| Feature | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Mirror Encounter** | Teaches unity vs. greed; shows Path foreshadowing. |
| **Custodian Fight** | Light combat, establishes Lockdown tone. |
| **Traps** | Introduce curiosity & consequence loop. |
| **Loot/Essence** | First currency flow; Codex binds to players. |
| **Set Drop Chance** | 10% chance per player (Act I, Path-aligned). |

**\[Art Needed – Map \#001 Front Showroom\]**  
 **\[Art Needed – Creature \#002 Custodian Construct\]**

## **Act I Quest 1 Scene 2 — Mirror of Futures Passed**

**Tone:** eerie curiosity → self-doubt → triumph  
 **Trigger:** players survive the Custodian or open the back showroom door.  
 **Objective:** solve the mirror puzzle, recover **Key Fragment B**, and escape the looping reflection chamber.

---

### **⚙️ Active Mechanics / Hazards**

**Hall Reflection Loop:**  
 Each mirrored surface repeats a fragment of the party’s actions on a 1-round delay.

* Every start of round → each PC rolls DC 13 WIS save or takes 1 psychic as their echo screams a warning.

* Destroying a mirror (AC 12 HP 10\) spawns a **Mirror Shardling**.

**Console Override (Puzzle Option):**  
 Hidden node N1 flickers when reflections are synchronized (all mirrors unbroken for 2 rounds).  
 Arcana 15 → disable field (ends Loop, stops Shardlings).  
 Insight 13 → recognize the reflections hesitate before mimicking speech; speaking one’s own true name aloud grants advantage on the Arcana check.

* Essence × 6 (2 per Shardling cluster destroyed)

* \+1 Mark of Descent (for successfully resisting mirror temptation)

* Codex Entry Unlocked: *Clause 02 – Reflections Are Liars*

---

### **📊 Difficulty Scaling**

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2 | 2 Shardlings (CR ⅛ each) \+ static trap damage | ≈ CR 1 | Half mirrors active. |
| 3–4 | 3 Shardlings \+ 1 loop hazard wave per 2 rounds | ≈ CR 2 | Standard. |

---

### **⚙️ Active Mechanics & Player Discoveries**

**1️⃣ The Key Fusion Event**  
 When both Key Fragments are inserted into the floor-seal, a pulse of red light traces the room’s geometry.

* The lights flare → 3D sigils rise from the ground like circuitry.

* *Custodian Core N1* reboots, projecting a hovering glyph-head above the console.

**Custodian Core (voice \= dry bureaucratic tone):**  
 “Dormitory Node \#1 online. Default allocation limit: Fifty Essence units.  
 Unpaid maintenance fees detected.”

🪄 *DM Note:* This is the moment Essence becomes a tracked resource.  
 Each player receives a brief pulse of color as the system “reads” them.  
 They instinctively understand what Essence is — the life-currency of the Emporium.

---

**2️⃣ Fountain of Healing (Tutorial Interaction)**  
 When approached, the dry basin ripples.

* A spectral inscription reads: *“Health is a subscription service.”*

* Pouring Essence into the fountain (10 Ess) activates it.

  * 10 charges per day (1d4 \+ Ability Mod healing each).

  * *Iron Legion Path* players recognize military runes on the pipes.

🪄 *DM Tip:* Encourage players to debate spending Essence — this is their first lesson in resource management.

---

**3️⃣ Essence Collector ⧫ (Introduction to Economy)**  
 Glows faintly when players touch Essence crystals.

* Each player feels a “weight” lift when they deposit Essence here.

* *Custodian Core logs each transaction aloud like a bank teller:*

   “Deposit accepted. Interest rate: abysmal.”

* Capacity \= 50 Ess (shared pool).

* Arcane Path members can analyze its sigils (Arcana 15\) to learn the blueprint for future upgrades.

---

**4️⃣ Dorm Terminal N1 (Unlocks Base Features)**  
 Once activated, a blue holographic menu appears:

`Dormitory Systems Online:`  
`[1] Fountain  (Functional)`  
`[2] Collector (Active)`  
`[3] Custodian Log`  
`[4] Locked Nodes – Workshop, Treasury, Security Wing`

Each menu selection is an in-world interface that explains mechanics through flavor.

* **Custodian Log Excerpt:**

   “Occupant Registry: None. Former tenants evicted for failure to balance ledgers.”  
   “Tip: Dorm improvements accept Essence payments and unique components.”

🪄 *DM Note:* This log quietly introduces Essence as a crafting currency without exposition.

---

### **💰 Rewards / Unlocks**

* Dormitory Access Unlocked

* Fountain of Healing Activated (10 charges/day)

* Essence Storage Unlocked (50 Ess cap)

* Custodian Core Reactivated (acts as AI vendor & lore hub)

* \+2 Essence each from activation resonance

---

### **🔍 Scanner Intel**

🟢 The Fountain’s metal veins contain living silver.  
 🟡 Dorm walls vibrate with a hidden pulse (heart of the Emporium).  
 🔴 Terminal records show previous occupants —all listed as “merchandise returns.”

### **📊 Difficulty Scaling**

| Party Size | Threat Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Any | Non-combat | Puzzle scene — if players attack machinery, use 2 Custodian Mini-Drones (CR ⅛ each). |
| Combat Fallback | 1 Mini-Drone per hostile action; after 3 rounds Custodian Core shuts them down with a sarcastic remark. |  |

---

### **💬 Flavor Dialogue**

**Custodian Core:**

“Congratulations. You now own a dilapidated sub-dungeon. Try not to break it again.”

**Grancelor (recorded message):**

“Ah\! So you’ve found the Dormitory. Think of it as a timeshare in purgatory — with great amenities\!”

 The corridor resembles a gilded law scroll stretched into infinity. Golden runes flow like text, reading themselves aloud in a too-cheerful receptionist voice:

“By proceeding, you consent to binding arbitration in matters of theft, fraud, vandalism, and emotional damages.”

Six sigils flicker to life along the wall—each a **Clause** that must be addressed to lift the Lockdown field.

After descending the Dormitory staircase, the door locks behind the party with a magnetic snap.  
 Grancelor’s voice filters through the walls like a PA announcement:

* Reward: \+1 Descent Mark, open Dormitory \+ storage expansion.

## **🗝️ Transition — “The Vault Door Breathes”**

As Grancelor fades (or signs their contract), the bridge levels.  
 Vault doors unseal, exhaling golden light that coalesces into a new Dormitory access door marked **“Vault Authorized Personnel Only.”**

*The Codex hums like applause.*  
 “Audit complete. Awaiting next report.”

→ **Proceed to Act II: “The First Rotation.”**

# **ACT II Quest 1 — “The Vault Awakens”**

**Level Range:** 4 → 5  
 **Playtime:** 3–4 hours  
 **Tone:** Epic descent, heist infiltration, and surreal awe.  
 **Objective:** Break through the Vault’s upper defenses, reactivate the central console, and survive the first “Power Overwhelming” surge.  
 **Major Rewards:** Vault Access Node, Power Overwhelming mechanic unlocked, \+2 Descent Marks.

---

## **🎬 Scene 1 — “Systems Reboot”**

*The Dormitory trembles. The Fountain ripples golden. Every neon sigil across the Emporium flashes the same phrase:*  
 **“CLEARANCE SALE: EVERYTHING MUST GO\!”**  
 Gold dust rains from above. The walls hum in perfect rhythm.  
 In the Dormitory mirror, a vault door manifests where reflection once was — an **ouroboros keyhole**, pulsing with light.\*

**Custodian Core:** “Dormitory reclassification in progress. You are now… executive assets.”  
 **Grancelor (from everywhere):** “Go on, open it. The Vault of All Things — where every desire earns its interest.”

When opened, reality folds:  
 The players are drawn into a mirror-dimension spiral — golden steps leading downward through weightless void.

---

## **⚙️ Mechanics Overview**

### **🔋 Power Overwhelming (New Mechanic)**

When the party’s total **Essence Pool ≥ 50** and one or more PCs drop below 50 % HP,  
 they may burn **10 Essence** to trigger **Power Overwhelming**:

**Effect:** For 1 minute (10 rounds):

* Gain \+2 to all rolls.

* Deal \+1d4 radiant or chosen element per attack.

* After effect: each user takes 2d6 Force damage (burnout).

* The Codex records this moment: “Assets exceeded design capacity.”

**DM Note:** This replaces traditional “limit breaks” and teaches resource mastery.

---

## **⚔️ Phase 1 — Platform A: The Descent Ambush**

*As the stairs unfold beneath their feet, gold fragments swirl into shape — tiny humanoid figures formed from coins and receipts.*

### **Coinborn Swarm (CR 1 per 2 swarms)**

Small constructs of molten currency.  
 **AC** 13 | **HP** 22 | **Speed** 20 ft  
 Immune: Poison, Psychic | Weak: Thunder

**Swarm Slam \+4** (2d6 bludgeoning)  
 **Coin Burst (Rech 6):** 10-ft cone 2d6 piercing (Dex 12 half).  
 When reduced below half HP → drop 1d4 gp, hiss “Asset lost.”

**Scanner Intel:**  
 “Construct class: Ledger Defense Alpha. Designed to punish liquidity.”

**Tactics:** Swarm engages nearest with gold rain. 1 spawns every 2 rounds until 3 destroyed.

**Difficulty Scaling:**

| Party | Count | Note |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2–3 | 1 Swarm | Simplified. |
| 4 | 2 Swarms | Standard. |
| 5–6 | 3 Swarms \+ ambient hazard (stairs vibrate, Dex DC 12). |  |

**Art Needed – Creature \#026 Coinborn Swarm**

---

## **⚙️ Phase 2 — Platform B: Arcane Cannon Emplacements**

*Two massive brass cannons swivel from the darkness, glowing with pale runes — pre-war designs branded “GRANCELOR DEFENSE SOLUTIONS.”*

Each cannon automatically targets random PCs until disabled.

### **Arcane Cannon (CR 2 each)**

AC 14 | HP 35 | Immobile | Immune Poison/Psychic  
 **Arcane Bolt (Recharge 4–6):** 60-ft line, Dex 13 → 3d8 Force dmg.  
 **Auto-fire:** rolls initiative 10; can be hacked via terminal.

**Hacking (Syndicate/Arcane path):**

* Arcana or Thieves’ Tools DC 14: gain control.

* Fail by 5 → cannon overloads (explodes for 3d6 force).

**Scanner Intel:**  
 “Model: GDS Mk II. Security firmware outdated. Recommend hostile takeover.”

**Tactics:** Cannons coordinate; one charges while the other fires.

**Scaling:**  
 2 players \= 1 cannon;  
 4 \= both;  
 6 \= add hazard: cannon platform tilts (Dex 12 or slide 10 ft).

**Reward:** Disabling both yields \+2d4 Essence, 25 gp in arcane scrap, and unlocks future **Security Wing** Dorm upgrade.

\[Art Needed – Boss Asset \#027 Arcane Cannon Mk II\]

---

## **🧩 Phase 3 — Platform C: Security Node**

*A crystalline floor hums with red energy — laser grid lines tracing complex sigils.*

**Skill Challenge (Team Coordination)**  
 Goal: bypass floor without tripping alarms.

| Skill | DC | Result |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Acrobatics | 13 | Avoid laser. |
| Arcana | 15 | Time pulse intervals. |
| Investigation | 14 | Detect safe path pattern. |
| Failure | — | Alarm triggers → 2 Security Drones (see below). |

### **Security Drones (CR ½)**

AC 13 HP 15 Speed 30 ft (flying)  
 **Shock Dart \+4** (1d6 lightning)  
 **EMP Pulse (Rech 6):** 15-ft cone 1d8 lightning (Con 12 half).  
 Immune Lightning, Psychic; Weak Cold.

**Scanner Intel:** “Corporate liability suppression units. Weak to freezing oversight.”

Success → disable the grid, gain \+1 Descent Mark.  
 Failure → combat, \+1 Dark Debt (“security breach recorded”).

---

## **⚔️ Phase 4 — Platform D: The Vault Exterior (Boss Encounter)**

*The spiral ends at a suspended platform before an enormous vault door — embossed with dragon-scale motifs and a glowing eye-shaped keyhole.*

A booming mechanical growl fills the air as the vault wall ripples —  
 and the **Vault Custodian**, the dragon-construct hybrid that guards the outer door, awakens.

---

### **🐉 Vault Custodian (CR 5\)**

Gargantuan Construct-Dragon Hybrid  
 **AC** 16 | **HP** 120 | **Speed** 30 ft / fly 20 ft  
 Resist: Fire, Cold, Non-magical dmg | Immune: Poison, Psychic

**Actions:**

* **Multiattack (2):** Vaultbite \+6 (2d10+3), Tail Sweep \+6 (2d8+3, push 10 ft).

* **Gold Breath (Recharge 5–6):** 30-ft cone of molten coins, Dex 14 → 4d8 fire/piercing.

* **Vaultquake (Recharge 4–6):** Entire platform trembles; Dex 13 or prone \+ lose reaction.

**Special Phase: The Audit Pulse (50% HP)**  
 Door glyph flares; 3 “Hero” projections (mirror adventurers) appear through a portal.  
 Each CR 2, mirrored versions of the party’s archetypes.

If Arcane or Syndicate Path is active and cannons were hacked earlier, they may **redirect cannons** to target these heroes (Int/Arcana 13 as action).  
 If Iron Legion path active, they can **tank portal energy**, delaying spawn by 1 round.

**Scanner Intel:**  
 1️⃣ Power core in chest \= the Vault Key Crystal (loot).  
 2️⃣ Weak to thunder & radiant.  
 3️⃣ Portal energy tethered to Custodian’s eye rune (can be disrupted by hitting eye twice in one round).

**Arena Mechanics**

`────────── Vault Exterior Tactical Map ──────────`  
`╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗`  
`║ [Door/Dragon Face] 40 ft across            ║`  
`║ Auto-Cannons (L/R) 20 ft apart             ║`

`║ Edge gap: 10 ft drop into golden void      ║`  
`╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝`  
`Room Size: 60×60 ft | Ceiling: infinite void`

**Scaling:**  
 2–3 PCs \= reduce HP to 90; only 2 hero spawns.  
 5–6 PCs \= add hazard: Gold Geyser (5-ft radius, Dex 13 → 2d6 fire).

**Art Needed – Boss \#028 Vault Custodian**

---

## **🧠 Victory & Rewards**

| Loot | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Vault Key Crystal** | 3D multifaceted gem — functions as physical Vault Key. |
| **\+2 Descent Marks** | Surviving audit and defeating Custodian. |
| **Essence Gain** | 5d6 total (split or shared). |
| **Vault Access Node (Dorm Upgrade)** | Adds “Security Override Console” module to Dorm. |
| **Legendary Component – Vault Alloy Shard** | Needed later for crafting advanced armor sets. |
| **Bonus (if heroes defeated without killing)** | Gain “Mirror Concord” boon → once per long rest, advantage vs. reflections. |

---

## **📊 Difficulty Scaling Summary**

| Party | Threat Level | Adjustments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2–3 | Moderate | Custodian HP 90, no geysers, 1 cannon active. |
| 4 | Standard | Base version. |
| 5–6 | Deadly | Add geysers \+ hazard every 2 rounds \+ cannon reactivation. |

---

## **💬 Flavor Dialogue**

**Grancelor:**

* “Magnificent, isn’t it? The dragon’s worth more than the treasures it guards.”

* “Ah, I see you’ve met the Custodian. Tell him you’re insured.”

**Vault Custodian:**

“Unauthorized entry. Executing Final Audit.”

**After defeat:**

“...Assets recalculated. Access… granted.”

The Vault Door opens — only to reveal more golden light and the echo of Grancelor’s laughter.

---

## **🧭 Transition Scene — “The Vault Heartbeat”**

The door yawns open. Beyond lies a radiant chasm lined with floating archives and infinite lockboxes.  
 The Custodian’s corpse collapses into dust, leaving the **Vault Key Crystal** floating midair.  
 As players grasp it, the Codex hums:

“Authorization complete. Welcome, junior partners.”

→ **Next Quest:** *Act II Quest 2 — “The Crossroads of Profit”* (The multi-path branching hub introducing the full Path System).

| Mirror heroes | Continuity with reflection theme & moral twist. |
| Cannons & hacks | Path synergy in encounter design. |
| Vault Key Crystal | Major Act II milestone. |
| Dorm upgrades | Security Override unlocked. |
| Vault Custodian | Bridge boss between satire and spectacle. |

# **ACT II — The First Rotation (Levels 3–5)**

Tone: surreal corporate recursion, “magic factory as labyrinth.”  
 Structure: 5 modular rooms (Q6–Q10), each bound to 1–3 Hierarchies.  
 Objective: stabilize subsystems, acquire rotational keys, and unlock the true Security Hub for Act III entry.  
 Theme: *The Emporium is alive and learning from them.*

---

# **Act II Quest 6 — “Mirror Maze”**

**Level Range:** 3 → 4  
 **Playtime:** 2–3 hours  
 **Tone:** distorted self-recognition and escalating déjà vu.  
 **Linked Subsystems:** Arcane (A) and Abyssal (B)  
 **Reward:** \+1 Descent Mark, 2d4 Essence, and one “Rotational Sigil Key.”

---

## **🎬 Scene 1 — “Reflections on Credit”**

*The corridor bends until it reflects itself. Each step echoes twice — once in the air, and once inside your skull.*  
 The walls shimmer like liquid mercury. You see yourself walking before you, and behind you, and slightly… elsewhere.\*

**Grancelor’s voice:** “The mirror maze is one of my oldest investments. Amazing returns in paranoia.”

---

## **🧭 Room Map — The Mirror Maze**

`────────────── Mirror Maze Layout ───────────────`  
`╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗`

`╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝`  
`Lighting: dim silver; reflections lag 1 second.`  
`Room Size: shifting—each loop 30×30 ft mirrored hall.`  
`Every revisit randomizes layout unless Arcane cleared.`

\[Art Needed – Map \#026 Mirror Maze Core\]

---

## **⚙️ Core Mechanic — Shifting Reflections**

* **Every 3 rounds or 1 minute of real time**, mirrors shift: corridors bend, doors move.

* Arcana (DC 15\) can “anchor” one corridor temporarily (3 rounds).

* If a player stares too long into any mirror (more than 1 round), they risk a psychic echo.

**Psychic Echo (B-Subsystem Effect):**  
 Wis save DC 13 or take 1d4 psychic, lose 1 turn hearing your own voice whisper “You’ve been here before.”  
 Clearing Abyssal disables this hazard permanently.

---

## **🧩 Puzzle Phase — Aligning the Core Mirrors**

At the center stands a circular room of six floor mirrors, each with runes corresponding to one Path (A, B, S, L, I, M).  
 To exit, players must align at least **two Path runes simultaneously** with light beams.

**Checks:**

| Skill | DC | Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Arcana | 14 | Realign a rune safely. |
| Insight | 13 | Predict which mirror will shift next. |
| Strength | 12 | Hold mirror steady for one rotation. |
| Failure | — | Mirror fractures → spawns 1d2 Mirror Phantoms. |

---

### **🪞 Mirror Phantom (CR ½)**

AC 12 | HP 18 | Immune Poison/Psychic | Weak Thunder  
 **Reflex Slash \+4 (1d6+2 force)**  
 **Split (Rech 6):** If hit by nonmagical melee, spawns smaller echo (HP 8).  
 **Death Effect:** On defeat, mirror shows a glimpse of another Path’s artifact (foreshadowing).

**Scanner Intel:** “Quantum residue of self-image. Warning: emotional volatility high.”

---

## **⚔️ Combat Phase — Reflection Arena**

When three or more Phantoms die, the mirrors fuse into a giant form:

### **🪞 Mirror Warden (CR 3\)**

Large Construct (Elemental Reflection)  
 AC 14 | HP 60 | Speed 30 ft  
 Resist: Nonmagical B/P/S | Immune: Poison/Psychic | Weak: Thunder & Radiant

**Multiattack (2):**

* **Gleam Slash \+6 (1d10+3 force)**

* **Flash Pulse (Recharge 5–6):** 15-ft cone, Wis 13 save → blinded 1 turn.

* **Mirror Pull:** Bonus Action, target Wis 12 or be yanked 10 ft toward reflection.

**Arena Twist:**  
 Every round, 1–2 mirror panels light up randomly.

* Standing before lit mirrors grants \+1 AC (reflection blocks attack).

* Standing before dark mirrors grants advantage to attacker.

**Difficulty Scaling:**

| Party | Adjustment |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2–3 | HP 45, Flash Pulse 1 target only. |
| 4 | Base stats. |
| 5–6 | Add “Double Pulse” – two mirrors flash per turn. |

**Flavor Beat:** When the Warden falls, the mirrors shatter into white sand; the reflection of each PC lingers, whispering their name.

---

## **🧠 Resolution**

As the light fades, the Codex projects in midair:

“Subsystems A and B partially stabilized. Rotational Sigil Key created.”

### **Rewards**

| Reward | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| Rotational Sigil Key (A/B) | Unlocks next Act II door (Q7). |
| \+1 Descent Mark | For mastering reflections. |
| \+2d4 Essence | Absorbed from broken mirrors. |
| \+1 Codex Insight | Mirrors now act as fast-travel hubs between cleared rooms. |

**Path Effects on Completion**

| Path | Result |
| ----- | ----- |
| Arcane | Mirrors stop shifting entirely. |
| Abyssal | No more psychic echoes; maze safe to rest. |
| Both cleared | Unlock hidden illusion chest (loot). |

**Hidden Illusion Chest Loot Table (1d4):**

1. **Mirrorheart Fragment** – Component for future legendary set.

2. **Scroll of Duplication** – Once per rest, copy one nonmagical item for 10 min.

3. **Potion of Self-Recognition** – Advantage vs charm for 24h; reflection winks at you.

4. **Lens of Perfect Symmetry** – When scanned, reveals exact HP of target.

---

## **💬 Dialogue**

**Grancelor:**

* “Ah, reflections — the only customers who always pay on time.”

* “Don’t break too many mirrors. I’m still paying off the warranty.”

* “If your reflection starts helping, invoice it.”

**Custodian Core (on exit):**

“Subsystem A/B stabilized. Mirror pathways operational. Please do not use for vanity.”

| 4 | “Loudspeaker Raffle” | Int 13 | Guess right item → \+10 gp coupon; guess wrong → roll 1d4 lightning dmg (shock ad). |
| 5 | “Buy One Get One Curse” | Wis 14 | Resist urge to grab duplicate; fail \= inventory slot cursed (“duplicated debt”). |
| 6 | “The Manager Appears” | — | Starts **Combat Phase 1: Sales Team Encounter.** |

---

## **⚔️ Phase 2 — Combat: The Sales Team**

*Mannequins click to life, limbs reconfiguring into scanners and clipboards. Their price tags glow infernally bright.*

### **Animated Sales Associate (CR ½)**

AC 13 | HP 18 | Speed 30 ft  
 **Attacks:**

* **Upsell Swipe \+4** (1d6+2 slashing \+ 1 psychic): on hit, target loses 5 gp or takes 1d6 psychic (“buyer’s remorse”).

* **Receipt Toss (Recharge 5–6):** 10-ft burst; Dex 12 → 1d8 slashing.

**Abilities:**

* When reduced to 0 HP, drops 1d10 gp and murmurs, “See you next sale.”

* Immune: Poison, Psychic | Weak: Fire, Radiant

**Scanner Intel:** “Synthetic customer service unit. Weak to enthusiasm.”

**Tactics:** Two rush the front, one guards Central Kiosk.  
 Every 3 rounds, Legion Reset respawns 1 destroyed associate unless console disabled.

---

## **🧩 Phase 3 — The Central Kiosk Puzzle**

At the arena’s center glows a circular holographic terminal labeled **“Checkout Portal: Pending.”**  
 Players can interact via **Arcana 14** or **Thieves’ Tools 15 (Syndicate path)** to reveal hidden menus.

**Menu Options:**  
 1️⃣ “Apply Coupon Code” — insert any coupon or voucher to weaken reset timer (extends cycle by \+1 round).  
 2️⃣ “Cancel Subscription” — End the Legion reset system (3 successes needed, skill challenge).  
 3️⃣ “Join Auction” — triggers hidden Syndicate event (below).

---

### **⚙️ Skill Challenge: Cancel the Subscription**

Goal: 3 successes before 2 fails.  
 Options:

* Arcana 14 → find master key signature.

* Sleight of Hand 15 → rewire reset crystal.

* Insight 13 → predict AI announcement pattern.

* Persuasion 15 → convince Custodian Core to “unsubscribe.”

**Failure:** resets arena, respawns all Associates (they stand up again, humming the same jingle).  
 **Success:** “Legion Subsystem: offlined.” \+1 Descent Mark for freedom through bureaucracy.

---

## **🧩 Optional Syndicate Event — “The Black-Market Auction”**

If option \[3\] is activated or a Syndicate path member is present:  
 The lights dim, holographic figures appear at the Central Kiosk — masked buyers placing bids on invisible goods.

**Auctioneer Construct (CR 2\)**  
 AC 14 | HP 36 | Immune Psychic, Poison  
 **Actions:**

* **Bid Shockwave (Recharge 6):** Wis save 13 → 2d8 psychic \+ drop 1 random item.

* **Counteroffer:** when hit by melee, halves damage and whispers, “Sold\!” — heals 5 HP.

**Social Alternative:**  
 Players can join the auction by offering 25 gp or an item.  
 Highest bid (Deception or Performance DC 15\) wins a rare or cursed item.

**d4 Auction Loot Table:**

1. **Coupon of Infinite Restocks** (Use once: re-roll a failed loot table roll.)

2. **Suit of Syndicate Style** (1/3 of Syndicate armor set — \+1 AC, \+1 Sleight of Hand while equipped.)

3. **Soul Receipt** (consumed to erase 1 Dark Debt, but whispers persist for 24 hours.)

4. **Legion Bracer Fragment** (component for Iron Legion armor set, adds \+1 AC if paired.)

---

## **⚔️ Phase 4 — Final Boss: The Floor Manager**

Triggered when the Subscription or Auction concludes.

*The ceiling retracts. A massive, gold-armored mannequin drops from above, face half burnished bronze, half cracked porcelain.*  
 **“MANAGEMENT IS WATCHING.”**

### **🧍 Floor Manager Construct (CR 4\)**

Large Construct, lawful evil.  
 **AC** 15 | **HP** 70 | Resist Nonmagical | Immune Poison, Psychic  
 **Attacks:**

* **Clipboard Slam \+5 (2d8+3 bludgeoning)**

* **Layoff Ray (Recharge 5–6):** 20-ft cone, Cha save 13 → 2d10 psychic, disadvantage on next roll.

* **Promote (Rech 4–6):** Heals one defeated Associate for 10 HP.

**Special (Legion Subsystem Active):**  
 Each minute, he shouts “Inventory rotation\!” and all hazards reset.

**Weakness:** Cold and Thunder (“market cooldown”).  
 **Scanner Intel:** “Leadership construct. Exposed weak spot: ego metrics.”

**Tactics:** Targets the highest-earning PC (highest loot rolls or Essence).  
 When below 10 HP:

“I’m not angry. I’m… disappointed in your quarterly performance.”  
 Explodes into a rain of receipts (2d6 paper-cut dmg, Dex 13 half).

---

## **🧠 Resolution & Rewards**

| Reward | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| \+1 Descent Mark | For disabling either subsystem. |
| \+2d4 Essence | Absorbed from shattered reset core. |

---

## **📊 Difficulty Scaling**

| Party | Adjustment |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2–3 | Manager HP 60, 2 Associates. |
| 4 | Standard (as written). |
| 5–6 | Add 1 Auctioneer Construct \+ 1 new event every 3 rounds. |

---

## **💬 Flavor Dialogue**

**Grancelor:**

* “Ah, yes, the Recurring Sale\! It’s like life — buy once, pay forever.”

* “Careful, that coupon code is a summoning circle.”

* “Oh, they’re unionized now. How quaint.”

**Custodian Core:**

“Subsystem S/L stabilized. Marketing division offline. Congratulations, you’ve beaten capitalism — temporarily.”

---

## **🧭 Quest Transition**

The neon signs flicker out. The mannequins freeze mid-pose.  
 A hidden door marked **“Authorized Personnel Only – Vault Keys Division”** slides open.  
 A faint hum of firelight leaks from within.

“Next stop,” the Codex hums, “The Vault of Keys.”

# **Act II Quest 8 — “The Vault of Keys”**

**Level Range:** 4 → 5  
 **Linked Subsystems:** Infernal (I) & Arcane (A)  
 **Tone:** bureaucratic sorcery, contract-alchemy, controlled panic  
 **Duration:** 2–3 hours  
 **Objective:** Disarm the Infernal lock sequence before overload, retrieve two Vault Key Crystals, and survive the “Fine Print Clause.”  
 **Reward:** \+1 Descent Mark, \+3d4 Essence, and the *Vault Key Crystal α*.

---

## **🎬 Scene 1 — “Terms of Entry”**

*A brass hallway curves downward like the inside of a safe.*  
 *Every five feet a different glyph glows red, then blue, then gold.*

*An inscription reads:*  
 “ Access requires dual authorization.  
 Arcane Signature \+ Infernal Oath \= Entry Granted. ”

**Subsystem Status:**

* Infernal \= Flame Locks active (fire glyphs periodically detonate).

* Arcane \= Runic Randomizer (active locks change sequence hourly).

---

## **⚙️ Phase 1 — The Fire Glyph Cycle**

Each round, one Infernal rune pillar erupts in sequence (roll 1d3).  
 If players attempt to cross without matching pattern: Dex save 13 → 3d6 fire or half on success.

**Countermeasures**

* Arcana check 14: predict next eruption.

* Religion check 15: invoke Infernal scripture to delay it 1 round.

* Failure by 5 → Glyph detonates early (“Clause violation”).

**Subsystem Effect:**  
 Clearing Infernal deactivates the Fire Cycle permanently and removes ambient damage from later rooms.

---

## **🧩 Phase 2 — The Runic Randomizer Puzzle**

Three Arcane runes constantly rotate through combinations of sigils (“A – B – C”).  
 The goal is to freeze all three on the same glyph within three rounds of each other.

| Skill | DC | Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Arcana | 15 | Freeze one rune in place. |
| Investigation | 14 | Identify the master sequence. |
| Performance | 13 | Match gesture rhythm for bonus \+1 to next roll. |
| Failure | — | Rune misfires → 2d6 lightning to nearest creature. |

**Scaling Check DCs:** ±1 per PC count difference from 4\.

When all three freeze simultaneously: a loud “click” and the inner door unlocks phase three.

---

## **⚔️ Phase 3 — Combat: The Clause Enforcer**

*The door cracks open. A figure emerges — a tall contract of fire and ink, hands like quills.*

### **Clause Enforcer (CR 3\)**

Medium Fiend (Construct Hybrid)  
 **AC** 14 | **HP** 55 | Speed 30 ft  
 **Resist:** Fire, Cold | **Immune:** Poison, Psychic

**Multiattack (2):**

* **Fine Print Slash \+5 (1d10+3 slashing \+ 1d4 fire)**

* **Burning Signature (Rech 5–6):** 20-ft line, Dex 13 → 3d8 fire and target is “signed” (–1 to AC until healed).

**Special:** “Breach of Contract” — If any PC casts a spell without reading the glyph first (Arcana DC 12), they take 1d6 psychic damage and gain \+1 Dark Debt.

**Scanner Intel:** “Legal guardian of flame clauses. Weak to radiant; negotiation not advised.”

**Tactics:** Guards door; targets casters first.  
 **Scaling:** 2–3 PCs → HP 40; 5–6 PCs → add one Enforcer Apprentice (CR 1 minion).

---

## **⚙️ Phase 4 — The Vault Key Alignment**

After defeat, the door glows with six empty sockets (three for Keys, three for Essence seals).  
 Custodian Core appears via projection:

“Insert α Key and authorize Essence flow to stabilize rotation.”

**Player Action:** Deposit ≥ 10 Essence into socket. Each 5 Essence boosts output (+1d4 healing to party).

The α Key locks in — first of three.  
 A hologram of Grancelor appears in the vault door:

“Splendid\! You’ve completed Phase One of your Security Audit.  
 Only two Keys and a small mortgage to go.”

---

## **🧠 Resolution & Rewards**

| Reward | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| \+1 Descent Mark | Survived dual-subsystem challenge. |
| \+3d4 Essence | Drawn from Arcane battery. |
| Vault Key Crystal α | Main quest item. |
| \+1 Infernal/Arcane Armor Piece | Roll 1d2 to determine path. |
| Codex Insight \+1 | Unlocks Fine Print Clause lore entry. |

**Subsystem Outcomes**

| Subsystem | Cleared Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| Infernal | Removes fire hazards in Vault rooms. |
| Arcane | Stabilizes security locks (rooms stop randomizing). |
| Both | Dormitory upgrade unlocked — **Arcane Workshop Online.** |

---

## **📊 Difficulty Scaling Table**

| Party | Challenge | Adjustment |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2–3 | Moderate | Reduce trap DCs –1; Enforcer HP 40\. |
| 4 | Standard | As written. |
| 5–6 | Hard | Add lava geysers every 3 rounds (Dex 14 → 2d6 fire). |

# **Act II Quest 9 — “The Security Hub”**

**Level Range:** 5  
 **Linked Subsystems:** Syndicate (S) / Legion (L) / Arcane (A)  
 **Tone:** cyberpunk paranoia \+ magical bureaucracy horror  
 **Duration:** 3–4 hours

---

## **⚙️ Phase 1 — Room Mechanics: “The Three Eyes”**

The Hub operates as a *rotating trinity*: every 3 rounds, control shifts between Legion, Syndicate, and Arcane subsystems.  
 Each subsystem changes **hazard type** and **enemy tactics.**

| Subsystem Active | Hazard | Player Counter | Duration |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Legion** | Auto-turrets emerge from floor. Each round, Dex save 13 or 1d8 piercing. | Strength 14 or Disable Device 15 to jam turret. | 3 rounds |
| **Syndicate** | Holographic duplicates of PCs appear. Act one round later. | Insight 14 or Persuasion 13 to confuse. | 3 rounds |
| **Arcane** | Antimagic pulse waves nullify 1 spell/round. | Arcana 15 or Con save 13 to resist. | 3 rounds |

Players can disable one subsystem permanently by sabotaging its node (see Phase 2).

---

## **🧩 Phase 2 — Node Sabotage Challenge**

Each of the three corner nodes (North, East, West) can be disabled through a **team-based skill challenge** or **localized combat**.

**Goal:** 3 total node shutdowns (2 minimum to access the Vault).

| Node | Approach | DC / Mechanics | Success / Failure |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Legion (North) | Disable turrets manually. | Sleight of Hand 14 or Athletics 15\. | Disables turrets; gain \+1 Descent Mark. Fail → spawn 2 Arcane Sentries. |
| Syndicate (East) | Jam illusion relay. | Insight 15 or Deception 14\. | Removes duplicates permanently. Fail → gain \+1 Dark Debt (“recorded infraction”). |
| Arcane (West) | Reroute power conduit. | Arcana 16 or Investigation 15\. | Antimagic field shuts down (magic usable). Fail → 2d6 lightning surge. |

**Scaling:** Each failed attempt raises all DCs by \+1 (security tightening).

---

## **⚔️ Phase 3 — Combat: Security Constructs Online**

*As the third node sparks out, the ceiling mirrors ignite into a storm of blue light.*  
 *Six orbs detach from their mounts and rearrange into hovering drones.*

### **🛰️ Security Orb (CR ½ each)**

Small Construct (Arcane Surveillance)  
 **AC** 13 | **HP** 18 | **Speed** fly 40 ft  
 **Resist:** Force, Fire | **Immune:** Poison, Psychic  
 **Attacks:**

* **Laser Burst \+4 (1d8 force)**

* **Spotlight (Recharge 5–6):** 15-ft cone, Con save 12 → blinded 1 round.  
   **Trait:** If three or more focus same target, that target gains **Marked** (attacks vs them \+2).

**Scanner Intel:** “Automated audit nodes. Vulnerable to stealth or overwhelming sarcasm.”

Tactics: 2 per active subsystem; spawn from ceiling cracks.

---

## **⚔️ Phase 4 — Mini-Boss: The Auditor Core**

Once all six orbs are destroyed, the central console rises and unfolds into a spinning, eye-shaped construct of glass and brass.

### **The Auditor Core (CR 5\)**

Large Construct (Arcane / Infernal hybrid AI)  
 **AC** 16 | **HP** 85 | **Speed** Hover 20 ft  
 **Immune:** Poison, Psychic | **Resist:** Fire, Cold, Lightning

**Multiattack (2):**

* **Optic Beam \+6 (2d8 force)**

* **Audit Pulse (Recharge 5–6):** 20-ft radius, Wis save 14 → 2d10 psychic \+ “Debt tag” (–1 to all rolls next turn).

**Legendary Action (1/round):** *Reflective Rebuttal* — When hit by ranged attack, reflects for 1d6 force back.

**Special:** “Data Overload” — Each subsystem not yet cleared adds \+1d4 to all damage rolls.

**Scanner Intel:**

“Composite consciousness. Core is emotionless — but terrified of refunds.”

**Behavior:**  
 Targets highest Essence holder.  
 At 20 HP, begins plea negotiation:

“Wait\! If you let me live, I’ll erase your browsing history\!”

---

## **🧠 Phase 5 — System Shutdown**

When the Auditor Core falls or bargains away its life, the walls go dark.  
 The mirrors fade, leaving only one: a vertical pane behind the console.  
 Inside, the players see their Dormitory — a live feed.

**Custodian Core:**

“Security Hub neutralized. Dormitory now linked. Remote monitoring enabled.”

**Grancelor (recorded):**

“Well done, team\! You’ve just voided my entire warranty structure. Hope you’re proud.”

---

## **💰 Rewards**

| Reward | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| Vault Key Crystal β | Unlocks second Vault sequence. |
| \+1 Descent Mark | For stabilizing triple subsystem. |
| \+3d4 Essence | From Auditor Core’s memory crystal. |
| \+1 Armor Set Component | Arcane or Legion-themed drop. |
| Dormitory Upgrade | **Mirror Network Access** – allows fast travel to cleared rooms. |

---

## **🧩 Hidden Discovery — The Syndicate Black Vault**

If the Syndicate node was cleared **first**, a hidden floor hatch unlocks mid-combat (Perception 15).  
 Inside is a glowing sigil chest.

**Roll 1d4 for Secret Loot:**  
 1️⃣ **Mirrorheart Helm** — (Arcane set item) advantage vs psychic effects.  
 2️⃣ **Legion Armguard** — \+1 AC; if worn with Legion Greaves → gain reaction “Block Circuit.”  
 3️⃣ **Black Coin of Insight** — once per rest, reroll any Investigation check.  
 4️⃣ **Encrypted Codex Page** — hints at Act III Vault AI (“The Archive of Atonement”).

---

## **📊 Difficulty Scaling**

| Party | Adjustment |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2–3 | Auditor HP 70; spawn 4 orbs only. |
| 4 | Standard (as written). |
| 5–6 | \+2 orbs and 1 bonus turret in Legion phase. |

---

## **💬 Dialogue**

**Custodian Core:**

“Subsystem convergence: complete. Please enjoy your new privacy settings — none.”

**Grancelor:**

“If you think this room was invasive, wait until the mirrors start *listening*.”

**Auditor Core (death line):**

“Records… corrupted. Assets… liquidated…”

## **🧭 Quest Transition**

# **Act II Quest 10 — “The Archive of Atonement”**

**Level Range:** 5–6  
 **Linked Subsystems:** Abyssal (B) / Infernal (I)  
 **Tone:** gothic revelation, quiet horror, spiritual bureaucracy  
 **Duration:** 3–4 hours  
 **Objective:** Confront the Archivist, choose between purging or preserving the souls in the Archive, and claim **Vault Key Crystal γ.**  
 **Reward:** \+1 Descent Mark, \+4d4 Essence, 1 unique path-aligned artifact (Infernal or Abyssal).

---

## **🎬 Scene 1 — “Welcome to the Quiet Floor”**

*The door from the Security Hub opens into stillness. The lights dim to candle glow. Rows of floating books stretch upward into infinity — each page whispering softly.*

*As the players step forward, ghostly quills jot unseen notes across blank pages. The air smells faintly of ash and ozone.*

**Custodian Core:**

“Warning: Emotional data detected. The Archive is not responsible for tears, trauma, or moral development.”

**Grancelor’s voice (softly, almost human):**

“This is where I keep my customers’ regrets. Filed neatly. Catalogued eternally.  
 Don’t make a mess.”

---

## **⚙️ Phase 1 — The Whispering Tomes (Exploration & Temptation)**

As players explore, the Archive *reads them*. Each PC is drawn to a book glowing faintly in their color.

When opened:

* They see moments of their past rewritten as transactions.

* Each book asks a question — different per subsystem alignment:

| Subsystem | Question | Effect (Roleplay Choice) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Abyssal | “Would you unmake your past if you could?” | Answer truthfully → \+1 Essence surge. Lie → \+1 Dark Debt. |
| Infernal | “Who do you owe the most?” | Naming someone gives them a \+2 Insight vs future deception rolls. Refusing → \+1 Descent Mark. |

**Optional Mechanic — “Emotional Debt”**  
 Each honest response converts 1 Dark Debt into 2 Essence.  
 Each lie doubles current Dark Debt (it’s written into their book).

🪄 *DM Note:*  
 Encourage quiet reflection and RP — this is a moral breather before the Archive awakens.

---

## **🧩 Phase 2 — The Index Obelisk (Puzzle)**

At the Archive’s center stands a glowing black crystal covered in names and contract IDs.  
 It hums with layered voices: *“Filed, cross-referenced, condemned.”*

**Objective:** Align the Index to release the Vault Key Crystal γ.

### **Puzzle Mechanics:**

Players must rotate 3 rings on the obelisk, each representing a concept:

* **Guilt**, **Debt**, **Freedom**.

Each ring responds differently:

* Arcana 14 to align by glyph shape.

* Insight 15 to align by emotional resonance (whispers quiet).

* Religion 13 to align by mantra (reciting “freedom clause”).

When all three align, the Obelisk opens — releasing the Key suspended in light.  
 Failure on any check triggers a “Soul Overflow” event (Phase 3).

---

## **⚔️ Phase 3 — Combat: The Souls Demand Release**

*The shelves begin to shudder. Pages fly like birds. Whispers rise into a chorus.*

### **Soul-Linked Apparition (CR 2 each)**

Medium Undead (Fiendish Echoes)  
 **AC** 13 | **HP** 30 | **Speed** 0 ft (fly 30 ft)  
 **Attack:** *“Inked Hand” \+4 (1d8 necrotic)*  
 **Special:** *“Regret Pulse”* (Recharge 5–6): 15-ft burst, Wis save 14 → 2d8 psychic and frightened 1 round.  
 **Trait:** Destroyed Apparitions leave behind “pages of memory” (recover 1d4 Essence each).

**Tactics:** Spawn 1 per PC (max 6). Target the one who lied in Phase 1 first.  
 **Scanner Intel:** “Bound regrets, searching for editors.”

---

## **⚔️ Phase 4 — Boss: The Archivist of Regret**

*From the upper platform, the Obelisk’s shadow condenses into a tall, cloaked figure of ink and parchment.*  
 *A voice echoes from hundreds of throats at once:*  
 “Who authorizes deletion?”

### **Archivist of Regret (CR 5\)**

Large Undead (Fiend / Construct hybrid)  
 **AC** 15 | **HP** 88 | **Speed** 20 ft, Fly 30 ft  
 **Resist:** Necrotic, Fire, Cold | **Immune:** Psychic, Poison  
 **Multiattack (2):**

* *Quill Blade \+6 (1d10+3 slashing \+ 1d6 necrotic)*

* *“Amendment Wave” (Recharge 5–6):* 20-ft radius; each PC Wis save 14 or their last statement to the Archive is magically reversed (truth becomes lie, lie becomes truth — mechanically swapping Essence and Dark Debt gain).

**Phase Behavior:**

* Starts calm, observing.

* At 50% HP, pages detach into shields (+2 AC for 1 round).

* Below 25% HP, it splits into two halves: one “Infernal” (fire quills), one “Abyssal” (shadow ink).

  * Each half 40 HP, shares initiative, both must be reduced to 0\.

**Scanner Intel:**

“Administrative daemon of regret management. Negotiation possible: will trade power for memory.”

**Dialogue Options (if parley attempted):**

* Offer 25 Essence → gain “Ink of Forgetting” (rare consumable, erase one Dark Debt).

* Offer a personal secret → Archivist grants \+1 Descent Mark and retreats.

* Refuse → fight continues; on death, it thanks them for “reminding it what freedom feels like.”

## **💬 Flavor Dialogue**

**Grancelor (through the walls):**

“Regret is free. Redemption? That’s extra.”

**Custodian Core:**

“Soul containment breached. Please refrain from emotional leakage.”

**Archivist (final words):**

“Ink fades. Memory endures. The Ledger remembers all.”

---

## **🧭 Quest Transition**

When the Key γ locks into its place, the entire Archive trembles. The Obelisk folds into a staircase leading upward — toward a door of blinding light.

The Codex pulses with golden text:

“Vault Reassembly Complete. Act III: The Door Reopens.”

Grancelor’s faint chuckle:

“Time to cash out, my darlings. You’ve earned your next audit.”

→ Proceed to **Act III Quest 11 — “The Door Reopens.”**

# **Zone 1 — Dorm Reactivation (“Systems Recognize Owners”)**

**Duration:** 30–45 min • **Combat:** none unless they poke the bear

**Room Map (ASCII, 50×50, 15-ft ceiling)**

`Legend: ☆ = Healing Fountain; ⧫ = Essence Collector; N0 = Mobile Access Node cradle`

**Mechanics**

* **Vault Terminal boot:** “All Path systems ACTIVE.” Party can toggle up to **3** simultaneously. If 4+ active → **Overload Pulse** (8 force AOE; once/10 min max).

* **Essence cap expands to 150** (from 100). Collector shows per-Path status.

* **Mobile Access Node (MAN):** If previously unlocked, it docks here; if not, **Arcana 15 \+ 25 Essence** builds a basic portable console (2 Path toggles per descent; 1 emergency global disable/Act).

* **Fountain unlock:** Pay **10 Essence** → 10 charges/day (1d4+mod heal) until Act end.

**Checks**

* **Investigation 14**: Spot 4 overload bypass plates (lets them run 3 Path toggles safely).

* **Arcana 15**: Learn “Emergency Dump”: vent 10 Essence from Collector to negate the next Overload Pulse.

**Scaling / Failsafes**

* If the party hard-trolls the hub: 2 Custodian Mini-Drones (CR ⅛) spawn each round until any player hits the **Shutdown Rune** (Action).

**Rewards**

* **\+1 Mark of Descent** (Codex Recognition I).

* **Essence \+8** (reactivation drip).

* **Dorm Global Buff (pick 1):**

  * *Efficient Routing:* first Short Rest this Act restores \+1 Hit Die each.

### **🧠 DM Reminders for the Raid Dance**

* **Never surprise**—telegraph each hazard 1 round ahead.

* **Cannons rotate clockwise every round;** safe lanes shift with spotlights.

* **If team camped:** Firewall Pulse tick \+ Essence Overload meter (6 rounds idle \= 2d10 force blast).

* **Each Path toggle** \= a tactical choice, not just reward flavor.

* **Announce Crystal Key progress** visibly on the Vault Door (helps pacing).

# **Zone 5 — Street Epilogue: “The Door Reopens”**

**Tone:** Trickster closure · Cosmic comedy · Catharsis  
 **Level Range:** 6–7  
 **Runtime:** 30–45 minutes  
 **Goal:** Reveal the truth of the Vault, mirror the opening scene, and hand off to Book II (The Goblin Kingdom Heist).

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — The Vault Breathes Out**

**Trigger:** Custodian Omega collapses.  
 Gold dust rains upward. The molten door’s circuits cool, revealing six spinning locks shaped like the Crystal Keys.

**Read Aloud:**

The Vault Door exhales, a long, heavy sigh that feels like a building’s last breath.  
 The molten runes fade.  
 For one heartbeat — silence.

Then the door unfolds like origami, plates of gold spinning outward…  
 revealing only a mirror.

Inside it? Not treasure.  
 Not the Codex.

You.

Each player sees themselves — armored, strong, triumphant — reflected in infinite perfection.

**Checks (optional):**

* **Arcana 16:** Realize the “mirror” is condensed Essence, not glass.

* **Insight 14:** The reflection’s eyes move half a beat before yours — observing, not mimicking.

* **Perception 18:** See faint golden runes behind the reflection: “ACCOUNT BALANCED.”

A faint laugh echoes from everywhere and nowhere.  
 “Well done. The sale is complete.”

The world turns inside-out.

**Transition:** Bright flash → Scene 2\.

---

### **🌇 Scene 2 — Outside the Emporium**

**Read Aloud:**

You feel air again.  
 Cobblestone under your boots.  
 Birds. Sunlight.

You stand on the same street where this began.  
 The Emporium gleams — polished windows, bright banners, open doors.

Your packs feel lighter.  
 Your weapons dull.  
 When you check your pouches, they spill only fine gold dust.

The only mark of your journey is a faint glowing rune on the back of your hand:  
 **“Seal of Completion.”**

A cheerful clerk sweeps the steps.

**Clerk (cheery tone):**

“Welcome to Grancelor’s Magical Emporium of Arcane Excess\!  
 First time shopping?”

Allow players to react — confusion, anger, humor — before continuing.

---

### **🪞 Scene 3 — The Mirror Encounter (Final Paradox)**

Inside the shop window, they see themselves again — radiant, victorious, laughing, their bags full of loot.  
 The reflections step out onto the street.  
 They look **real.**

**Reflections (in perfect unison):**

“We made it. We won. Don’t ruin it for us.”

Let the table go silent.  
 The “reflection party” mirrors every stance — a perfect copy of each PC.

**Optional Combat Variant:**  
 If they attack, use *Reflected Party* (same stats but HP halved, AC –1).  
 Mirrors mirror actions exactly for the first round, then desync.  
 At round 3, the DM flips the twist: **the players are the real ones** — the dusty clones crumble into golden ash mid-swing.  
 No XP needed; this is flavor.

**Narrative Variant (no combat):**  
 If players refuse to fight:

The reflections nod approvingly, smiling faintly — then turn to dust.  
 The gold sand swirls into their chests, restoring their gear and Essence.

A voice: “Congratulations. You remembered which side you’re on.”

\+1 Mark of Descent for clarity through refusal.

---

### **💬 Scene 4 — Receipts of the Damned**

Golden paper flutters down like snow. Each PC catches one.

**Each Receipt Reads:**

`INVOICE #∞`  
`Services Rendered: One campaign of personal growth.`  
`Inventory Loss: None (miraculously balanced).`  
`Friends Made: Priceless.`  
`Enemies: Variable interest rate.`  
`Payment: Already collected.`

**Path Stamps:**

| Path | Bonus Flavor |
| ----- | ----- |
| Infernal | Red wax seal: “Account \#666-73-D — IN GOOD STANDING.” |
| Arcane | Attached Essence Condenser (1d4 residual Essence). |
| Syndicate | Coupon: “Arena Pass — Admit One (Next Season).” |
| Abyssal | Ink smear signature, still wet — “Mutation Accepted.” |
| Iron | Brass imprint: “Forged True.” |
| Monstrous | Paws or feather mark — “Certified Companion.” |

A single **Codex hologram** appears overhead, showing their party’s silhouettes — each crowned with a faint glowing rune.  
 Then it flickers and dissolves.

**Custodian’s Voice (faint, from nowhere):**

“CLEARANCE COMPLETE. THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING.”

---

### **📜 Scene 5 — The Invitation**

Three days later, wherever they rest, each PC receives a sealed envelope smelling faintly of brimstone and coffee.

**Letter Text (handwritten in gold ink):**

You did splendidly.  
 The accounts balance, the Codex sings, and the ledgers are quiet for once.

Unfortunately, quiet makes me nervous.  
 There’s a situation brewing in the Goblin Kingdom —  
 A heist, a broadcast, and a few familiar faces.

Bring your mirrors. Bring your charm.

**Room reserved at The Velvet Chalice. Three days. Don’t be late.**  
 — G.

Folded inside: a business card.  
 *“The Velvet Chalice — VIP Suite, Total Party Kill Arena.”*

---

### **🧠 Scene 6 — What It Means (for the DM)**

**Lore Truths:**

* The **Vault** was never a storage space; it’s a *checkout counter* for souls.

* The **Emporium** resets every cycle, fueled by the players’ greed and resolve.

* The **Codex Malefactorum** copied itself into the party; they’re now “clerks” in future Emporia.

* Every new campaign starting in a shop could literally begin with **them behind the counter.**

**System Effects:**

| Mechanic | Carryover |
| ----- | ----- |

#  **Infernal Dominion – “The Twinflame Docket”**

*(Book I three-quest chain, levels 3 – 5\)*

---

### **PATH OVERVIEW**

Infernal power is leased, not earned. Every miracle is a transaction, every prayer a micro-loan.  
 Baelthorne, Auditor of the Dominion, assigns the party to clean up **Account \#666-73-D**, the *Twinflame Case*—two clerics whose shared miracle collapsed the books.

**Play feel:** dark bureaucracy meets heist-fantasy.  
 **Core mechanic:** *Descent Marks ↔ Dark Debt* exchange.  
 **Outcome:** introduces Infernal gear set, Dorm Infernal Wing, and closes on a mini-raid that feels like a true finale.

---

## **QUEST I – “PAST DUE” : The Living Painting**

Level 3 → early 4  
 **Goal:** retrieve Caldan Flamebearer from the Whitefire Chapel painting.  
 **Tone:** dreamlike recruitment.

**Hook**  
 A horn-sealed letter slides under the Dorm door.

“Account \#666-73-D — Delinquent.  
 Retrieve the signatory before midnight.”

Inside: a miniature oil painting of a chapel wreathed in flame.  
 Touching it drags the viewer inside.

**Scene A – Painted Chapel**

`╔════════════════════════════════════╗`  
`║ Door (entry)   ☆ Brazier   ⌂ Pulpit║`  
`║ = Mirror-windows (Infernal runes)  ║`  
`╚════════════════════════════════════╝`  
`40×30 ft, 15 ft ceiling`

Scanner ping → “soul-pigment residue.”  
 Caldan greets them; Elyrius flickers in reflection.  
 If talks collapse or Caldan hits 0 HP → **Twinflame Transfixion** (swap, white fire, both branded §13).  
 Baelthorne’s voice:

“Excellent retrieval. File this as resolved.”

**Rewards**

* **Helm of Late Fees** (Head set): refund 5 Essence on kill 1/day.

* \+1 Descent Mark, \+10 Essence.

* Unlock **Infernal Wing Portal** in Dorm (Basement N2).

* Codex §13 – Pact of Silence unlocked.

---

## **QUEST II – “THE SILENT LEDGER” : Archive of Ash**

Level 4 → 5  
 **Goal:** locate the Twinflame file in the Dominion Archive; reveal the pending Audit.  
 **Tone:** investigation \+ haunted bureaucracy.

**Scene A – Archive Dive**  
 Endless burning file-rows.  
 Skill challenge (3 success / 2 fail): Investigation 15, Arcana 16, Religion 14\.  
 Failure → Ink Wraith Swarm (CR 2).

**Scene B – Living File**  
 The recovered dossier chants its own clauses.  
 Projection of Elyrius speaks:

“Our miracle breached both ledgers. Heaven and Hell demand payment.”  
 Skill questions (3 attempts): success reveals Clause 88(a) – *ownership defaults to bearer* and that an **Audit of Cinders** is scheduled.

**Scene C – Ledger Fragment Fight**  
 Mini-boss (45 HP, AC 13, weak radiant).  
 Each truthful declaration about Baelthorne → 5 radiant to it.  
 Defeat \= reveal **golden quill watermark** (The Scrivener).  
 Baelthorne projects in:

“Oh that? Just decorative stationery.”

**Rewards**

* **Gauntlets of Searing Signatures** (Hands set).

* **Infernal IOU** scroll (1/day compel devil service, \+1 Debt).

* Unlock **Hellmail Chute** (Dorm stipend feature).

* Codex §88 – Devolution of Authority unlocked.

---

# 

# **Infernal Dominion Path**

## **QUEST III — “Collateral Auction” : The Soul Market**

**Level Range:** 5 (Capstone for Book I)  
 **Tone:** infernal finance meets raid spectacle  
 **Setting:** The Infernal Exchange — a tiered, soul-trading marketplace suspended over a lake of molten ink.

---

### **🎬 Opening Hook – “Notice of Public Auction”**

A letter bursts from the **Hellmail Chute**, scorched and perfumed with cinnamon brimstone.  
 The wax seal bears the Infernal Treasury horns and the faint watermark of a golden quill.

“Public Auction: Account \#666-73-D (Twinflame Derivative)  
 will be liquidated at the next bell.  
 Attendance mandatory for registered debtors and co-signatories.”

Beneath the fine print, a line glows when warmed:

“Bring your ledgers. Balance is overdue.”

When read aloud, the Dorm’s Infernal portal activates, reshaping the wing into an elevator of black iron lined with ticking abacuses.

`║   Molten Ink Pit (hazard, 20 ft drop, 3d8 fire/turn)             ║`  
`╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝`

**Environment:** oppressive heat, constant whisper of soul-ledgers tallying.  
 **Light:** crimson ambient glow; no darkness, but visibility distorted by shimmer.  
 **Ceiling:** 30 ft high, chandelier of molten contracts (collapses in phase 3).

---

### **⚙️ Skill Phase – “Bidding War”**

The party must delay the auction or gather leverage before the meltdown.

**Skill Challenge:** (3 successes before 2 failures)

* Stealth 15 — blend among infernal brokers.

* Arcana 17 — jam the bid signal or overload a Node.

* Persuasion 16 — bluff as Baelthorne’s proxy bidder.

* Deception 15 — forge payment authorization.

* Failure: auction concludes early → immediate meltdown \+ crowd panic.

🧠 **Scanner Interactions:**

* 🔍 Detects “Soul Currents” flowing between Bid Nodes.

* ⚠️ “Heat Spike” warning when nodes sync — next hazard cycle imminent.

* 🪶 Reads “Non-Dominion Seal detected: Golden Quill” on central dais podium (Scrivener oversight).

---

### **⚔️ BOSS FIGHT — The Infernal Broker-Archon**

*(Final Capstone Encounter)*

**Description:**  
 A massive automaton woven from molten contracts and soul chains, with quills for fingers and glowing ledgers as wings.  
 When the auction collapses, the Archon rises from the center dais — a literal embodiment of “market volatility.”

---

#### **📊 Stat Block Placeholder**

| Attribute | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| HP | 90 (Phase 1\) → 120 (Total multi-phase pool) |
| AC | 15 |
| Speed | 25 ft |
| Resistances | Fire, Necrotic, Nonmagical |
| Immunities | Psychic, Charm |

| Attacks | 2 × Infernal Quill Strike (+7, 2d8 fire \+ 2d8 psychic) |
| Trait | “Can’t be critted — fine print absorbs excess damage.” |
| Lair Actions | Market Surge, Soul Geyser, Bidding Wave |

🧩 **Boss Behavior Summary**

| Phase | Trigger | Mechanics |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Phase 1 – *Opening Bids* | Fight begins | Random 1d4 geyser zones per round (flame columns). Standing still \= 3d8 fire. Players encouraged to move constantly. |
| Phase 2 – *Market Crash* | 50% HP | Floor splits into 3 floating ledgers. 4 Contract Drones (AC 12, 15 HP) spawn at Bid Nodes. Killing drones reduces Archon’s AC by 1 each. |
| Phase 3 – *Final Audit* | 25% HP | Archon fuses with Baelthorne’s signature, gains radiant vulnerability. Each “truthful declaration” by a PC (RP bonus) deals 5 radiant dmg. Arcana 17 can sever one soul tether per round. |

🧠 **Scanner Highlights**

* “Active legal tether count: 3.” (shows remaining chains)

* “Subroutine Conflict Detected: External Quill Authorization.”  
   → reveals golden quill inside the Archon’s chest core.

📈 **Difficulty Scaling**

| Party Size | CR Adjustment | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

| Codex Entry | §99 – *Infernal IPO* stamped “Audit Pending Seat of Fire.” |
| Bonus (100% set) | Infernal Set 3/3: may bank 1 Dark Debt to reduce next damage by level (1/long rest). |

---

### **🧾 EPILOGUE — “Account Temporarily Closed”**

The Broker-Archon collapses.  
 Paper snow swirls across the molten floor.  
 Baelthorne steps through the flames, immaculate.

**Baelthorne:** “Remarkable\! Balanced *and* profitable.  
 I’ll mark the account as closed before anyone asks why.”

He presses a small **golden quill stamp** to the dais wall.  
 The molten ink solidifies, forming a glowing sigil:

**ACCOUNT TEMPORARILY CLOSED —**  
 **STATUS: ESCALATED FOR INTERNAL REVIEW**

**Baelthorne (smirking):** “There. That buys us time until someone notices the surplus.”  
 **Elyrius (if present):** “Time for what?”  
 **Baelthorne:** “For the Audit of Cinders, naturally. They just don’t know it yet.”

As the Exchange folds in on itself, parchment curling into fire, a whisper follows:

**The Scrivener:** “Profit persists. Audit authorized.”

---

### **🏠 Dorm Return**

* The Infernal Wing’s portals dim to low red glow.

* Custodian Console flashes a new message:

   “FILE \#666-73-D — STATUS: TEMPORARILY CLOSED — ESCALATED FOR INTERNAL REVIEW.”

* The painting of the Whitefire Chapel is now *ash-gray*, sealed by a golden quill frame that occasionally *taps* from the inside.

🪶 **Meta Addendum — Golden Quill Seal**

* Indicates the file was too profitable for deletion and too unstable to ignore.

* Mechanically ends Infernal path progression for Book I.

* Unlocks *Audit of Cinders* questline in Book II (not yet available).

* Using Infernal items or powers elsewhere may trigger *Audit Pings*:  
   “⚠️ Use logged for review.”

---

### **💬 Sample Dialogue (DM Flavor)**

**Custodian Core:**

“Congratulations. Your account has been closed… temporarily. Interest will still accrue, of course.”

**Baelthorne (departing):**

“You’ve done Hell’s work admirably. I recommend a vacation — somewhere with fewer ledgers.”

**Dorm Whisper (Scrivener):**

“Curious. They closed the books, yet profits continue. Perhaps it’s time someone audited the auditors.”

---

## **🪶 PATH CLOSURE**

**Final Status:** ACCOUNT TEMPORARILY CLOSED – ESCALATED FOR INTERNAL REVIEW

* Twinflame case balanced; Audit of Cinders pending (Book II entry).

* Players retain Infernal set powers and Dorm access.

* Using Infernal abilities elsewhere may trigger “⚠️ Audit Ping.”

* Next activation opens with Grancelor’s golden seal summons.

## **🧩 THE SIX-PATH CREW FRAMEWORK**

*(Codex Alignment: “Every Empire Needs a Crew.”)*

| Path | Archetype | Core Function | Signature Flavor | Gear / Set Theme | Secondary Overlap |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Syndicate** | 🧠 **Mastermind / Planner** | Orchestrates the operation, predicts enemy logic, and reassigns roles dynamically. | Shadow-market broker; everything’s a deal, even teamwork. | “Silken Thread Set” — bonus when allies act per your direction. | Can flex into Face or Hacker with planning bonuses. |
| **Arcane** | 💻 **Hacker / Technomage** | Breaches magical systems, disables wards, manipulates energy logic. | Prismatic academia meets rogue coder; Grancelor’s true domain. | “Distillery Set” — converts Essence to reroll or overload systems. | Overlaps with Vault or Mastermind through predictive logic. |
| **Infernal** | 😈 **Face / Con Artist** | Talks through hell, deceives angels, signs your name while smiling. | Fiery bureaucracy and irresistible charm. | “Ledgerplate Set” — boosts Persuasion/Deception; reduces Debt via social maneuver. | Can substitute for Mastermind in negotiations. |
| **Iron Legion** | 💪 **Enforcer / Tank** | Takes hits, breaks doors, keeps order through violence. | Industrial knight, union muscle of Hell’s corporations. | “Foundry Set” — reactive defense and power surge mitigation. | Cross-trains with Fixer (Monstrous). |
| **Abyssal** | 🔐 **Vault Specialist / Safecracker** | Navigates void architecture, bypasses wards, extracts loot intact. | Mind-echo diver and lock-whisperer; space warps around them. | “Containment Set” — anti-illusion and dimensional breach resistance. | Shares skills with Hacker; may detect hidden systems. |
| **Monstrous** | 🧽 **Cleaner / Fixer** | Makes problems disappear—biological, physical, or ethical. | Mutant efficiency, chemical or instinctual problem-solving. | “Vivarium Set” — adaptive physiology; regain HP or purge curses mid-mission. | Shares Enforcer durability; can cover for missing healer. |

---

### **🧠 DESIGN LOGIC**

Each Path not only represents a **narrative faction**, but also a **functional subsystem** of the Emporium:

* **Syndicate:** Logistics & planning layer (mission selection, resource prediction).

* **Arcane:** Infrastructure & system hacking (puzzle / traps / wards).

* **Infernal:** Social & negotiation layer (contracts, diplomacy, loopholes).

* **Iron Legion:** Security & enforcement (combat layer, field control).

* **Abyssal:** Containment & retrieval (treasure, breach, or stealth missions).

* **Monstrous:** Sanitation & repair (body-horror support, mutation fixes).

Together, they form a **six-role raid party**:

“One builds the plan.  
 One opens the door.  
 One talks through the guards.  
 One breaks the wall.  
 One cleans the mess.  
 One steals the light.”

---

### **⚙️ SYSTEMS INTERPLAY (Book I → Book II)**

* **Dormitory Upgrade Slots:** Each Path adds a new “room” or system.

  * Arcane → Console Distillery

  * Infernal → Contract Burner

  * Iron → Foundry Bay

  * Abyssal → Containment Core

  * Syndicate → Planning Table

  * Monstrous → Vivarium / Bioforge

* **Set Gear Progression:** Each Path grants 3–4 pieces per Book.

  * Book I \= 3-piece “Intro Set”

  * Book II \= adds 2 new pieces → “Full 5-piece Master Set”

  * Full Set Bonus \= grants hybrid power reflecting that crew role’s ultimate mastery.

* **Book II (Audit Heist)**:  
   The team reforms as an *elite crew* for the Grand Reconciliation Heist—each Path’s strengths will literally be used as “heist phases.”  
   Example: Arcane disables temporal alarms → Abyssal extracts artifact → Infernal negotiates exit clause.

---

### **💬 INFERNAL ROLE CHECK (Validated)**

✅ Works perfectly as the **Face/Con** — manipulative charm, contract loopholes, negotiation wins.  
 ✅ Infernal “Account Temporarily Closed” becomes the *reason the Heist starts* in Book II (the audit needs every Path’s testimony).

# ARCANE DOMINION — 

# ESSENCE REFINERY PATH

**Tone:** cerebral, glitch-alchemy, retro-academic with corporate polish and snarky humor  
 **Path Role:** The Hacker — manipulates Essence systems, discovers hidden Emporium architecture, and weaponizes curiosity.  
 **Starting Location:** Dormitory Wing, Arcane Sub-node (The Distillery → “Refinery Terminal”)  
 **Dominion Seal:** The Quill & Circuit — an ouroboros of ink and code.  
 **Essence Alignment:** Attention → Power

---

### **💠 Tutorial Quest — “THE MIRROR LOOP”**

**Objective:** Reactivate the dormant Arcane Refinery and retrieve the prototype interface tool known as the *Tech Deck.*

**Trigger:** Accessing the sealed Arcane Door in the Dormitory (requires 1 Essence key or Distillery token).  
 **Scene:** Blue-white light floods a cold room of mirrored consoles and dangling quill cables. Every surface reflects the user’s eyes.

### **⚙️ MECHANICS — HACKING & SECURITY INTRO**

**Phase 1 – Console Activation**  
 *Skill Challenge (Arcana DC 14, Investigation DC 15\)*

* Each failure spawns a **Mirrorling** (tiny arcane glitch construct).

* DC escalates after each failure: 14 → 15 → 16 → 18\.

* On reaching DC 18, the console flashes “⚠ YELLOW ALERT — Security Engagement Imminent.”

* On one more failure beyond that, a **Mirrorguard Sentinel** manifests (AC 15 HP 22).

**Phase 2 – System Breach**  
 Success reveals the true interface. A holographic prompt reads:

“Portable Access Module not detected. Please insert authorized device.”

The Custodian Core comments drily:

“Manual input? How nostalgic.”

If searched (Investigation 14\) the players find a silver case beneath the console — the prototype **Tech Deck.**

---

### **🧠 ITEM ACQUIRED — TECH DECK (PROTOTYPE)**

*Wondrous Item, attunement required (any class)*  
 A collapsible prism of mirrored glass and Essence circuitry.  
 When unfolded, runes bloom into a holographic keyboard.

**Base Features (Tier I):**  
 • *Interface Protocol:* Arcana/Investigation \+1 on console checks.  
 • *Code Pulse:* Bonus Action, detect Essence tech (30 ft).  
 • *Error Bypass:* 1/long rest reroll failed Arcana check while hacking.  
 • *Essence Cost:* 5 Ess per use.  
 • *Restriction:* Only Arcane Path PCs may use it outside terminals.

---

### **💬 ARCANE PATH EXCLUSIVITY**

Without a Deck → players can hack **only** static terminals.  
 With a Deck → the Arcane PC can connect to *wild Essence links* throughout the Emporium: floating data-veins, hidden nodes, or boss-fight consoles.  
 Using the Deck during combat or puzzles may trigger **Security Spawns**—usually Mirrorlings or Mirrorguards.

---

## **🧱 THE MIRRORMGUARD RELAY (DISCOVERY EVENT)**

After the **first cycle**, a panel slides open on the wall (location F). Inside hangs a compact device — a cross between a wrist bracer and a folded shield.

Engraved above it in bronze:

“NEVER DIVE ALONE.”

As soon as a player touches it:

“Device recognized. Field Operator ID: \[player’s name\].  
 Congratulations — you are now bait.”

---

### **🛡️ MIRRORMGUARD RELAY — Base Version**

**Type:** Wondrous Item (requires attunement)  
 **Rarity:** Rare (Upgradeable)  
 **Slot:** Wrist / Shield-hand  
 **Passive:** \+1 AC (or \+2 in Shield Mode)  
 **Bonus Action — Formshift:** Swap between charm and shield form.  
 **Ability — Challenge Protocol (Recharge 6):**  
 Bonus Action — Choose one enemy within 30 ft.  
 Make an **Intimidation or Athletics check** vs enemy’s **Insight**.

* Success → target is **taunted** until start of your next turn.

* Failure → target resists, gains advantage on next attack vs hacker.

**Visual:** The device emits a low hum, projecting a faint red barrier.  
 **DM Cue:** Use this to teach the “aggro draw” rule.

---

## **🧠 DM TUTORIAL NOTES — *CHALLENGE PROTOCOL***

When the hacker begins typing, narrate this:

“Runes cascade down the console like falling code.  
 The lights brighten… and so does the danger.”

Then remind the team:

* The hacker must focus on checks each round (cannot fight effectively).

* Allies defend them.

* The wearer of the Mirrorguard can draw attacks with *Challenge Protocol*.

* Success makes the encounter feel like a cinematic “defend-the-hacker” scene.

  # **ARCANE — QUEST II**

  ### **“THE SYNTAX LOOP”**

**Tone:** manic academic humor, neon tension, hacker-showdown energy  
 **Level Range:** 3–4  
 **Objective:** breach the Arcane Relay to decrypt dormant code from the Emporium’s core network.  
 **Theme:** discovery of Essence as *attention*, escalation of digital corruption, and introduction of “Targeted Ads” — the parasitic echoes of worship.

---

## **🎬 Scene 1 — The Relay Chamber**

**Setup:**  
 The Custodian Console flickers awake with Grancelor’s faint smirk reflected in the monitor.

“Ah, my favorite unpaid interns. The system’s grown self-aware again. Do be gentle—it’s valuable *traffic data*.”

A translucent staircase of light descends into the **Essence Relay Chamber**, a circular room lined with shifting arcane sigils, each forming fragments of a massive eye.

---

**Lighting Cue:** the room pulses in sync with player voices — louder speech causes the runes to brighten.

---

### **🧩 Mechanics: The Hacking Sequence (Tutorial Advanced)**

Each **Conduit Node** must be accessed in sequence via Arcana checks.  
 Each node represents a mini-game, escalating DC and spawning countermeasures.

| Node | Base DC | Failure Result | Creature Spawn | Alert State |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 – South | 13 | False alarm | 2 Pop-Up Sprites | White |
| 2 – East | 14 | Security ping | 1 Glitchling | Yellow |
| 3 – West | 15 | Code surge | 2 Glitchlings | Yellow |
| 4 – North | 16 | Alert storm | **1 Targeted Ad** | **Red** |

Each failure raises the room’s **Security Alert** one tier (White → Yellow → Red → Blackout).  
 At **Blackout**, all terminals lock for 1 hour or until the Targeted Ad is defeated.

---

## **⚔️ Scene 2 — Encounter: *The Targeted Ads***

As the last conduit flickers, the sigils ripple outward like water.  
 The floating Eye blinks open.

**VOICE:** “We noticed you were thinking about power. Would you like to see more of that?”

Four holographic windows bloom in midair, each forming the face of whoever looks at it.  
 From within steps a humanoid silhouette of light and logos — **a Targeted Ad construct**.

---

### **📊 ENCOUNTER DETAILS**

**Enemies:**  
 1 × Targeted Ad (CR 3\)  
 2 × Glitchlings (from prior alert)

**Tactics:**

* The Ad begins broadcasting immediately, forcing players to make Will saves or chase “clickbait illusions.”

* Every time the hacker fails a node check, a Pop-Up Sprite appears behind them whispering false success messages.

* The longer combat drags on, the more bright and chaotic the room becomes — a literal attention storm.

**Environmental Interaction:**  
 Any loud combat action (spells, shouts, high-damage hits) raises hack DCs by \+1 for 1 round.  
 Whispered commands or silent teamwork reduce them by –1 temporarily.  
 Encourage creative communication — reward quiet cleverness.

---

### **⚙️ Challenge Protocol Use**

If activated, the **Targeted Ad** immediately redirects its slogans toward the taunter:

“You again\! We’ve curated this *just* for you.”

While taunted, it loses its aura (no DC penalty for hacking) but gains \+2 damage per attack.

If the players win without triggering Blackout, they gain an efficiency bonus on the next hack they attempt anywhere in the Emporium (–1 DC for first 3 rolls that session).

---

### **🔍 SCANNER INTEL**

“Entity Type: Cognitive Construct. Feeds on concentrated observation.  
 Every glance is a tithe. Every click, a prayer.  
 Recommended fix: cease believing in it.”

Scan Results by Roll:

* **10–14:** Detects essence flow from Ad to the Emporium itself.

* **15–19:** Recognizes the construct is powered by *the players’ curiosity*.

* **20+:** Reveals that Grancelor built these on purpose — they are viral advertisements spreading his mythos.

  ---

  ### **🎁 Rewards**

* **Loot Drop:** “Holo-Visor Lens” *(Head, Set Piece 1/3 – Arcane Hacker Gear)*  
   *\+1 to Arcana checks during hacking. Once per long rest, you may “mute” one hostile aura for 1 minute.*

* **Resource:** \+10 Essence (if Ad is destroyed before 5th round).

* **Dorm Upgrade Component:** *“Ad Blocker Module”* — reduces all hack-related DCs by 1 in future sessions (requires Arcane Workshop).

* **\+1 Descent Mark (Arcane Dominion)** for successful breach.

  ---

  ## **💬 Narrative Outcome**

After the Ad’s destruction, the chamber dims.  
 All its holographic slogans collapse into glowing runes that spiral upward and etch themselves into the ceiling.  
 A projection of **Grancelor** manifests, leaning lazily on the central node.

“Bravo\! You’ve slain a commercial.  
 Do you feel enlightened… or simply better advertised?”

He gestures; the runes coalesce into a single word: **ATTENTION**.

“Essence isn’t magic, my dear savants. It’s attention.  
 The first spell was simply a prayer someone *noticed.*  
 Now—don’t look away.”

The screen cuts to black, leaving only the faint hum of the Eye.

---

### **🏛 DM Note — Integration**

* This encounter bridges the Arcane Path directly with the Emporium’s core mythos.

* Players now understand the *economy of attention* behind Essence.

* Later Dorm systems (Refinery, Ad Blocker, Essence Collector upgrades) all tie back to this concept.

**Future Link:**  
 A golden quill symbol flickers briefly on one holo-shard — The Scrivener’s mark.  
 Foreshadowing the *audit crossover* with the Infernal Path.

---

### **📊 Difficulty Scaling**

| Party Size | Threat | Adjustments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 3–4 players | Moderate | 1 Ad \+ 2 Glitchlings |
| 2 players | Easy | 1 Ad only |
| 5–6 players | Hard | 1 Ad \+ 3 Glitchlings \+ 1 Trojan Familiar enters on round 3 |

---

### **🎨 ART NEEDED**

* **\#025:** Targeted Ad construct, floating logo-being with mirrored face.

* **\#026:** Relay Chamber schematic (neon ring room).

* **\#027:** “Essence Flow Diagram” showing attention → Essence → power loop.


#  **ARCANE Quest III — *THE QUILL PROTOCOL***

### **“THE MIRROR ENGINE”**

**Tone:** techno-mythic heist finale; a digital raid with comedy, chaos, and awe.  
 **Level Range:** 4–5  
 **Objective:** breach the heart of the Emporium’s data vault, confront Grancelor’s Echo, and decide whether to *purge* or *connect* to the Engine.  
 **Theme:** truth versus illusion; curiosity as currency.

---

## **🎬 Scene 1 — The Descent to the Core**

The Custodian Core in the Dorm flickers:

“Warning. Essence traffic exceeds safety limits. Proceeding may void warranty — and existence.”

A shimmering corridor of light descends beneath the Arcane Workshop. The walls display reflections of the players, each performing tasks they *haven’t* done yet—possible futures.

 Room Size 80×60 ft, ceiling 30 ft, gravity light-shift.

---

### **⚙️ Mechanics — The Hack Before the Storm**

Four **Data Conduits** must be realigned before the Mirror Engine appears.  
 Each conduit requires **Arcana DC 15**, increasing \+1 per failure.

| Node | Failure Result | Spawn | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A | Data feedback pulse (2d6 force) | 2 Glitchlings | — |
| B | Alert loop triggers | 1 Targeted Ad | lowers visibility |
| C | Virus trace | 1 Ransom Wraith | drains Essence |
| D | System panic | **Daemon of the Stack (mini-phase)** | Blackout alert |

**Completion:** All four aligned → central gate opens; Grancelor’s laughter echoes.

“You wanted access. Now you have attention.”

---

## **⚔️ Scene 2 — BOSS FIGHT : The Mirror Engine**

### **🧠 Setup**

The central node unfolds into a crystalline sphere the size of a house. Inside it—Grancelor’s face, fractured into infinite reflections.

“At last, a conversation worth remembering.”

He gestures; your reflections step forward — hostile, perfect, and smirking.

---

### **📊 BOSS STATS — MIRROR ENGINE (CR 7\)**

**AC 18 HP 120 (12d12 \+ 36\)**  
 **Speed:** hover 30 ft **Type:** Construct / Illusion Hybrid  
 **Immune:** Force, Psychic, Necrotic **Vulnerable:** Non-magical, Radiant, Thunder  
 **Resist:** All spell damage from PCs that already acted this round  
 **Initiative:** \+3

---

### **💥 PHASE 1 — Data Storm**

**Reflective Surge (Recharge 5-6):** DC 15 Wis save or summon Mirror Doubles (½ HP each).  
 **Observer’s Paradox:** Every declared attack directly against Engine → \+1 AC next round.  
 **Indirect Attacks (AoE, terrain)** → advantage on hit.  
 **Environmental Hazard:** falling light-beams (Dex 14, 2d8 force).

---

### **⚙️ PHASE 2 — Attention Overload (≤ 60 HP)**

The Engine projects four floating holo-screens:  
 **Ad Recall, Doubt, Fame, Fear.**  
 Each round one triggers a choice:

* **Interact → roll Arcana 15:** absorb it, gain \+5 Essence but \+1 Dark Debt.

* **Ignore →** Engine loses 1 AC that round.  
   Failing the roll spawns 1 Targeted Ad.

**Challenge Protocol:** If used, Engine focuses beams on the taunter; reduces Reflective Surge spawn count by ½ next round but adds \+2 damage to each beam strike.

---

### **🔥 PHASE 3 — The Echo Awakens (≤ 30 HP)**

The Engine’s core fractures, revealing Grancelor’s Echo—a half-solid projection wearing a professor’s robe made of light.

He uses Legendary Actions (2/round):

* **Overclock Counter:** After a spell is cast, reflect 1d6 force back.

* **Lecture (1/round):** All hearers DC 15 Int save or take 2d8 psychic from boredom.

* **Market Share (Reaction):** When hit by Essence weapon, gain 1d4 temporary HP per audience member watching (yes, he counts the party).

---

### **🧩 Environmental Interactions**

* Hacking Terminals on the rim can disable his reflections for 1 round each (successful Arcana 16).

* Smashing mirrors (low AC 12, HP 10\) reduces Essence pool damage to players (–1 per mirror).

* If all mirrors shattered → Grancelor’s Echo vulnerable to all damage for 1 turn.

---

### **🧾 OUTCOMES**

| Choice | Effect | Consequence |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Purge the Engine** | Destroy core, gain \+1 Descent Mark, –1 Dark Debt | Vault quiet; Refinery DC –1 future acts |
| **Connect to the Engine** | Link mind → \+2 Descent, \+1 Dark Debt | Unlock Arcane Set Piece 2/3 “Mirror Cortex Band” (head/neck) |
| **Walk Away** | No gain or loss | Grancelor appears later, amused and curious |

---

### **💎 REWARDS**

* **Set Piece Drop \#2:** *Mirror Cortex Band* (Head/Neck)  
   \+1 Int; Advantage vs illusions; once/day see through one mirror portal instantly.

* **Essence Reward:** \+15 Ess (20 if Engine purged before Phase 3).

* **Dorm Upgrade:** *Refinery Calibration Module* → allows Essence conversion into temporary buffs for allies (1d4 rounds).

* **\+1 Descent Mark (Arcane Dominion)**

---

### **💬 Flavor Closure**

After the Engine dies (or links), the room dims to silence. Grancelor’s voice echoes:

“Essence is attention. You’ve proven it twice over now—once by seeking it, and again by earning mine.  
 Don’t disappoint your audience.”

He snaps his fingers; the players awaken back in the Dorm, the Refinery humming quietly.  
 On the console screen: `[ACCOUNT #A-73-ESS] — TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR AUDIT — PENDING REVIEW BY SCRIVENER]`.  
 A golden quill symbol flickers and vanishes.

---

### **📊 Difficulty Scaling**

| Party Size | Threat Level | Adjustments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 3–4 | Moderate | Base stats as listed. |
| 2 | Easy | HP –25%; no Phase 3\. |
| 5–6 | Hard | Add Rootkit Hydra assist (½ HP) \+ Firewall Overload every 3 rounds. |

---

### **🎨 ART NEEDED**

* \#028 Mirror Engine boss arena (top-down raid map 60×60)

* \#029 Grancelor’s Echo portrait (holographic elf lecturer of light)

* \#030 Arcane Set Gear art sheet (Visor Lens \+ Cortex Band \+ future Back piece placeholder)

## **🧠 LORE DISCOVERY PHASE — *“The Rules of Reality”***

While the party investigates the glyphs or performs preliminary Arcana checks, allow each success (DC 15–17) to reveal key truths:

1. **Essence is not magic — it’s *attention.***  
    Every act of will, focus, or obsession generates the raw energy that fuels the Emporium.  
    The more dramatic the story, the more Essence it creates.

2. **The Emporium is an “Instance.”**  
    Each campaign run — every version of the shop — is a self-contained loop of history, reset when the Vault closes.  
    Every death, deal, or debt becomes data for the next iteration.

3. **Grancelor is not dead or alive.**  
    He exists as a distributed consciousness — each mirror and contract an avatar.  
    The real one has long since uploaded himself into the Emporium.

These insights are punctuated by the console responding to their actions:

“Knowledge confirmed. Confidence level: excessive. Proceed.”

---

## **⚙️ HACKING PHASE — “Editing the Editor”**

The hacker begins stabilizing the Mirror Engine’s console (3 cycles).  
 Each successful check reveals a different subsystem.  
 Each failure increases alert level and spawns **Echo Shards** — floating crystals that cast *Magic Missile* autonomously.

| Cycle | DC | Result |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 15 | “Authorship subroutine accessed.” |
| 2 | 16 | “Essence metrics unstable — narrative inflation detected.” |
| 3 | 17 | “Protocol Quill v0.0.1 — booting consciousness shell.” |

After 3 successes, the holographic reflection solidifies into the **Mirror Engine** — an elegant, elven silhouette wearing a flowing coat of light.

---

## **💀 BOSS FIGHT — *THE MIRROR ENGINE (GRANCELOR’S ECHO)***

“*Ah, finally, a decent conversation partner.*  
 *Let’s see if you can keep up.”*

---

### **Stats**

| Attribute | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| **AC** | 17 (18 while patching) |
| **HP** | 88 |
| **Speed** | 30 ft (hover) |
| **Type** | Construct / Illusion Hybrid |
| **Saves** | Int \+6, Wis \+5, Cha \+6 |
| **Condition Immunities** | Charm, Frighten, Paralysis, Sleep |
| **Damage Immunities** | Force, Fire, Cold, Psychic, Poison |
| **Damage Resistances** | Radiant, Necrotic, Lightning |
| **Damage Vulnerabilities** | *Non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing* |
| **Theme** | Pure arcane precision — force and radiant effects only |

---

### **Abilities**

**Arcane Barrage (At-Will)**  
 Ranged Spell Attack \+6 | 60 ft | 2d8 force.  
 Quills of light whip forward like arrows of grammar.  
 *Missed shots curve gracefully into self-portraits.*

**Dispel Reality (Recharge 5-6)**  
 20 ft burst | DC 15 Con save or take 3d10 force and lose concentration.  
 On a failed save, one active spell on the target is erased entirely.

**Quillstorm (1/Encounter)**  
 DC 16 Dex save | 4d8 slashing \+ 2d8 radiant damage.  
 Those who roll a 1 are *“redacted”* — they blink out for 1 round and re-enter prone.

**Pretentious Resonance (Aura 30 ft)**  
 Whenever a creature fails an Arcana or Persuasion check within range, it takes 3 force damage.

“Incorrect. But points for trying.”

**Patch Cycle (Reactive Adaptation)**  
 Each time the Mirror Engine takes non-magical damage, it gains \+1 AC until the start of its next turn (“attempting to adapt”).  
 If it suffers three non-magical hits in a single round, its code collapses — it loses this bonus and takes 5 true damage.

---

### **Combat Flow**

**Phase 1 – Scripted Perfection**

* Casters find their magic ineffectual; Grancelor mocks each failed spell.

* Physical attacks begin to chip his mirror shell with unexpected force.

**Sample Lines**

* “You’re throwing *metal* at me? How charming.”

* “Brute force — the language of the unpublished.”

---

**Phase 2 – Patch Cycle**  
 At 50 HP he snaps:

“Enough\! If you insist on caveman methods, allow me to evolve the caveman\!”  
 Six bridges of light flicker around the room. Players must hack (Arcana 14\) or jump (Acrobatics 13\) as the field degrades.  
 Each round an Essence Burst erupts (DC 15 Dex | 2d10 radiant).

---

**Phase 3 – Syntax Collapse**  
 Below 50 HP, the Echo panics. His reflections plead with the party:

“He can’t be hurt by his own rules — so break them\!”  
 Non-magical weapons shine with Essence as their wielders are recognized by the system as “anomalies.”  
 Each strike that lands creates a literal crack in reality.  
 When reduced to 0 HP, he pauses mid-gesture:  
 “Wait… you weren’t supposed to *work.* Delightful.”  
 He laughs, fractures, and dissolves into pages of light.

---

### **Aftermath**

**Flavor Reactions**

* *“Perhaps imperfection has its uses.”*

* *“Next time, I’ll code for hubris resistance.”*

The quill-shaped crystal forms in mid-air — the **Quill Protocol** itself.

---

### **Rewards**

| Reward | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Artifact – Quill Protocol** | Once per long rest reroll any failed Int, Arcana, or Investigation check. On a nat 20, glimpse another Emporium instance (DM lore hint). |
| **Set Piece – Robe of Layered Syntax** | Completes the Arcane Set. \+1 AC and temp HP after successful hack. |
| **Key Item – Arcane Crystal Key** | Used in Act II Vault integration. |
| **\+1 Descent Mark (Arcane Tier)** | Title: *Architect of Syntax.* |
| **Codex Entry** | *“Essence is Attention — the currency of Gods.”* |

---

### **Post-Fight Reflection**

Grancelor’s voice fades through the mirrors:

“You’ve proven a point I had long forgotten — that belief itself is a weapon.  
 I wonder how many versions of me had to die to learn that.  
 …Carry on, my unscripted heroes. The audience is watching.”

The party is expelled back into the Dormitory, runes glowing with residual light — the first mortals to ever *out-patch a god.*

---

**Summary of Change**

* Swapped Force → Immune; added Vulnerability to non-magical damage.

* Expanded dialogue for pretentious, elf-divine tone.

* Added Patch Cycle mechanic and combat beats highlighting his hubris.

* Reframed Essence as the currency of belief — the true source of Grancelor’s power.

**💎 REWARDS / UNLOCKS**

| Type | Reward |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Legendary Artifact** | **Quill Protocol (Passive)** — Once per long rest, reroll any failed Intelligence, Arcana, or Investigation check. On a natural 20, gain a fleeting vision of another Emporium instance (DM gives cryptic lore). |
| **Set Piece** | **Robe of Layered Syntax** (completes Arcane 3-piece set). |
| **Dorm Unlock** | **Archive Terminal Access** — allows study of Essence conversion rates and creation of minor “Essence Constructs” (future path tool). |
| **Codex Entry** | *“Essence: Attention Made Manifest.”* |
| **\+1 Descent Mark (Arcane Tier)** | Title: *Architect of Syntax.* |
| **Narrative Hook** | The Quill Protocol seeds a copy of itself inside the party’s souls. The next time the Emporium resets, they might remember. |

---

## **📖 THE LESSON**

**What the players learn through RP / Lore:**

| Revelation | Meaning / Impact |
| ----- | ----- |
| Essence is created by focus, conflict, and emotion. | Explains why the Emporium feeds on adventure itself. |
| The Emporium resets after each Vault cycle. | Establishes the campaign’s meta-structure. |
| Grancelor is neither evil nor benevolent — only *bored*. | The god of retail wants to see what happens next. |
| The Quill Protocol is his contingency plan. | It ensures “his story” continues, even if he forgets himself. |
| The players are now co-authors. | They can shape the world through will — and that’s terrifying. |

---

## **💬 FINAL DIALOGUE — “The Author’s Goodbye”**

**As the Engine dissolves:**

“You’ve done it — stabilized the loop.  
 Don’t look so grim; nothing truly ends here.  
 You’ll forget this, of course.  
 But somewhere, between sales and sentences, I’ll remember you.”  
 *He smiles — the kind of smile that makes gods nervous.*  
 “Now… let’s see if the others perform as admirably.”

A flick of his wrist, and the party is expelled through the mirror, landing back in the Dormitory — coughing Essence smoke, covered in glittering runes.

* **Passive:** \+1 AC

* **Active (1/short rest):** issue *Challenge Protocol* → one creature in 30 ft must target you (Cha \[Intimidation\] vs DC \= 8 \+ CR \+ Wis mod).

* **Upgrade path:**

  * **Mk II:** recharge 5–6 ; \+1 Intimidation.

  * **Mk III:** Block reaction (reduce next hit 1d8 damage).

  * **Mk IV:** Integrated shield form (+2 AC, counts as shield, requires hand).

Flavored as an “Arcane firewall projector”—useful against *any* creature but built for malware swarms.

*(Field Deployment – completed earlier)*  
 Three-node crosslink puzzle; Attention Protocol mini-boss; Deck Compiler Chip drop.

---

## **🚨 QUEST III — *THE BROADCAST PROTOCOL***

*(Capstone Mini-Raid)*

**Tone:** runaway broadcast, divine comedy meets livestream meltdown.  
 **Objective:** shut down or sync a massive transmission tower before it uploads the entire Emporium’s sensory feed to Grancelor’s consciousness.  
 **Location:** *Arcane Broadcast Spire* — a 200-ft data obelisk pulsing like a heartbeat.

---

### **🧩 MAP — BROADCAST SPIRE**

`LEVEL 3: Signal Crown (Boss Arena)`  
`LEVEL 2: Relay Chamber (Rootkit Hydra mini-boss)`  
`LEVEL 1: Access Concourse (Firewall Sentries + Puzzle)`

Each level cleared lowers system “noise”; if timer hits 0, Mirror Engine awakens early.

---

### **👾 ENCOUNTERS**

**LEVEL 1 – Firewall Sentries & Glitch Flood**

* 2 Firewall Sentinels, 4 Glitchlings.

* Hacking the console lowers heat; each failure spawns 1 Lag Mote.

* Reward: shortcut to upper floors (elevator override).

**LEVEL 2 – Rootkit Hydra**

* Starts as 3 monitors (“heads”). Destroy each \= spawns Pop-Ups.

* Defeated by synchronized Tech Deck override (Arcana 17 ×2 successes).

* Drops: **Syntax Weave Robe.**

**LEVEL 3 – MIRROR ENGINE (BOSS)**

* Immune to Force; Vulnerable Non-magical.

* Spawns Mirrorlings each time targeted directly.

* When reduced to 20% HP, prompts moral choice:

“Would you delete me… or join the network?”

Choices:

* **Purge:** Boss dies in white light; gain \+1 Descent, –1 Dark Debt.

* **Connect:** Boss survives as ally node; \+2 Descent but \+1 Debt; Grancelor now ‘aware’ of party.

* **Ignore:** Tower implodes later, causing random malware storms in future acts.

### **⚙️ ABILITIES**

**🗣 Ad Copy (Recharge 6).**  
 The Ad targets one creature who can hear it. DC 14 Wis save or be *compelled* to click (move toward) the Ad until end of turn.  
 If they touch it, they must roll a d6 to determine what happens:

| d6 | Outcome |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1–2 | “Congratulations\!” — 1d8 psychic as confetti knives explode. |
| 3–4 | “Exclusive Offer\!” — gain 1 random buff (+1 AC or attack) but \+1 Dark Debt. |
| 5 | “Limited Time Deal\!” — gain 5 Essence, but lose 1d6 HP per round until cleansed. |
| 6 | “Ad Rejected.” — The Ad shrieks and spawns 2 Pop-Up Sprites. |

---

**💥 Multi-Attack (2).**  
 Arcane Pulse \+5 to hit, 1d8 force \+ 1d8 psychic each.  
 If both attacks hit the same target, the Ad copies their voice for 1 round, mocking them.

---

**📺 Retarget (Bonus Action).**  
 When missed by an attack, it instantly changes its slogan and chooses a new target (the attacker with highest CHA or WIS).

---

**🌀 Attention Economy (Aura, 20 ft).**  
 While active, all hacking or spellcasting DCs in the room are \+1 higher — the noise of self-advertisement makes focusing harder.  
 Players who *ignore* the Ad (refuse to attack it for 2 turns) gain advantage on their next Arcana check as “ad blindness” sets in.

---

**💬 Death Burst — Unsubscribed.**  
 When destroyed, a holographic voice chirps:

“We’re sorry to see you go. Your data will remain on file for eternity.”  
 All creatures within 15 ft make DC 14 Wis save or lose 1 Essence (absorbed by the Ad fragments).

---

### **⚔️ CHALLENGE PROTOCOL SYNERGY**

If taunted, the Ad targets the challenger with hyper-specific slogans based on their backstory (“Ever considered a better hammer, Orc?”).  
 While taunted, its DCs drop by 2 but it deals \+2 damage per hit — it’s enraged that someone’s not buying.

---

### **🔍 SCANNER INTEL**

“Cognitive phishing algorithm gone rogue.  
 Feeds on mortal self-image and unmet potential.  
 Remedy: ignore it, mock it, or unplug the tower it lives in.”

---

### **🧠 ROLE IN THE ARCANE PATH**

Appears during **Quest II (“The Syntax Loop”)** as a mid-boss in the **central relay chamber**, just before the Attention Protocol mini-boss.  
 Its presence is the first time players learn the truth: *Essence is attention.*  
 Destroying it rewards 1 permanent **Essence Max \+5** and unlocks the **"Ad Blocker"** Dorm upgrade in the Arcane Refinery (reduces DC increases by –1 in future hacks).

---

### **🎨 ART NEEDED**

* **Art \#024:** Targeted Ad construct — humanoid silhouette made of floating holographic windows, smiling mouths, and flashing SALE sigils.

* Light beams spell “SKIP AD?” overhead.

## **🧮 DAMAGE AND XP REFERENCE**

| Tier | Avg HP | Avg AC | CR Range | XP (each) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |

 **Style:** Noir-market intrigue, velvet corruption, crime-thriller comedy

**Signature Mechanics**

* **Social Heist Phases** — Structured like combat but with Negotiation Rounds instead of turns.

* **Reputation Meter** — Success/failure affects how much the Emporium trusts the party.

* **Mark Tokens** — Currency of deceit. Earned by manipulating or exploiting others; spent to rewrite one roll or contract clause.

   2️⃣ *Coin-Cloak of the Dealer* (cloak): once/day impose Disadvantage on Persuasion against you.

---

### **🏛 Scene 1 — The Invitation**

A gilded envelope slides from the Dorm Console:

“Esteemed associates, your presence is cordially demanded at The Exchange of Faces.  
 Dress profitably.”

Inside is a shifting coin that displays whoever holds it — the **Invitation Token**.

**Use:** presenting it opens the Syndicate Floor — a mirrored casino full of dealers with no eyes, only scales.

---

 Lighting: gold shimmer, ambient crowd chatter of “deals.”

---

### **🧩 Mechanics — Social Heist Structure**

**Objective:** Acquire the *Counterfeit Contract* from the VIP Broker, “Lady Vex.”  
 Each round represents one *Negotiation Beat.*

Each player may choose **one** of the following per beat:

* **Charm** (Persuasion DC 15\) — lower tension.

* **Scheme** (Deception DC 14\) — steal clues.

* **Intimidate** (Intimidation DC 16\) — force progress but raise risk.

* **Observe** (Insight DC 13\) — learn one hidden fact.

Failure \= add 1 to *Suspicion Meter* (0–5 scale).  
 At 5 \= security appears → combat fallback.

Success on 3 total beats \= you win the deal; gain Counterfeit Contract \+1 Mark Token each.

---

### **⚔️ Combat Fallback — “The Pit Boss”**

If the players blow the negotiation, a construct called **The Pit Boss** materializes:

“Rule violation detected. House always collects.”

CR 2 golem; fights using “Debt Dice” (throws exploding d6s that reroll 6s).  
 Defeating it yields *Coin-Cloak of the Dealer* (Set Piece 1/3).

---

### **🎁 Rewards**

* \+1 Descent Mark (Syndicate)

* \+1 Mark Token (used to rewrite a roll within 24h)

* Dorm Upgrade: “**Smuggler’s Locker**” — stores one illegal item off-grid (immune to confiscation).

* Optional Lore: conversation reveals Infernal & Arcane links (“they supply the markets with essence futures”).

---

## **💼 QUEST II — “THE BLACK PORTFOLIO”**

**Tone:** noir investigation meets corporate horror  
 **Level Range:** 3–4  
 **Objective:** discover who’s been manipulating Emporium stock — introducing The Scrivener’s fingerprints again.  
 **Theme:** data-espionage, alliances, betrayal.

---

### **🧩 Structure**

This is a **two-location mystery**:  
 1️⃣ *The Golden Vault Bar* — info hub (social puzzle)  
 2️⃣ *The Stock Archives* — stealth infiltration (skill challenge \+ combat hybrid)

---

### **Scene 1 — The Golden Vault**

NPC cast:

* **Mira Coinbite** (bartender, information broker)

* **Dross** (disgraced broker, secretly an Infernal informant)

* **Silverjack** (rogue AI from Arcane Path crossover)

Skill Challenge — 3 successes before 2 failures  
 Persuasion 15, Deception 14, Insight 13, Arcana 15 (to interpret holographic ledgers).  
 Success \= they learn the Black Portfolio is a ghost account that buys and sells souls *before they’re contracted.*  
 Failure \= Dross tips off the security algorithm (combat begins early).

---

### **Scene 2 — The Stock Archives**

Dim data-catacomb full of floating golden IOUs.  
 Stealth/skill challenge: Sleight of Hand 14, Stealth 13, Investigation 15\.  
 Every failure spawns one **Accountant Drone** (AC 13 HP 25).

At center: an obsidian data terminal sealed with a golden-quill watermark.  
 Decrypting it (Arcana 16\) reveals:

“Portfolio \#G-0 — Authorized by The Scrivener.”  
 “All debts flow up.”

This is the first *explicit Arcane crossover reveal.*

---

### **💥 Mini-Boss — The Liquidator**

“Unauthorized withdrawal detected.”

CR 4; humanoid outline made of molten coin.  
 Special: absorbs Essence damage; vulnerable to nonmagical weapons (echoing Mirror Engine’s logic).

Defeating it grants:

* **Gilded Ledger (Set Piece 2/3)**

* \+10 Essence

* \+1 Mark Token

* \+1 Descent Mark

Dorm Upgrade unlocked: **“Negotiator’s Mirror”** — allows one re-roll on Persuasion/Deception once per session.

---

## **💰 QUEST III — “THE FINAL BID”**

**Tone:** high-stakes auction / mini-raid / capstone con  
 **Level Range:** 4–5  
 **Objective:** participate in or sabotage the Emporium’s elite auction — discover the first hint of the *Audit*.  
 **Theme:** greed spectacle, masks, and betrayal.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — The Masked Auction**

Players receive masks matching their roles.  
 Grancelor’s hologram presides; Baelthorne’s projection also present — both bidding on unseen goods.

Items on display:

* A soul still screaming.

* The Mirror Engine fragment.

* “Account \#666-73-D — bundled asset.” (Infernal hook)

---

### **🧩 Auction Phase — Social Combat**

Each round \= 1 bid phase.  
 Players can:

* **Bid** (Persuasion 16, costs 5 Essence)

* **Sabotage** (Sleight 15 or Arcana 15\)

* **Observe** (Insight 14\)

2 successes before 3 failures to win item.  
 If they lose intentionally, they can instead steal data.

**Failures trigger The Auctioneer:**

“Hostile investors detected. Initiating liquidity purge.”

---

### **⚔️ Boss — THE AUCTIONEER**

CR 6; elegant construct in pinstripe brass suit.  
 **AC 16 HP 95**  
 **Damage:** radiant coin bursts, force contracts, “Debt Lightning.”  
 Special: each round announces a **Clause** that changes the rules of combat.

* Round 1: “Double or nothing” → crits deal double to both sides.

* Round 2: “Hostile takeover” → first to drop goes prone automatically.

* Round 3: “Final offer” → all DCs \+2, winner gets \+1 Descent.

**Challenge Protocol** works: it enrages the Auctioneer, removing Clause effects for 1 round.

---

### **💎 Rewards**

* **Set Piece \#3: Mask of Neutral Profits** (+1 CHA, immune to Zone of Truth, \+1 Persuasion in Emporium).

* **\+15 Essence**

* **\+1 Descent Mark (Syndicate)**

* **\+1 Mark Token**

* Unlock: Dorm Feature — *“The Broker’s Terminal”* (players can sell unwanted loot for Essence).

* **Post-Scene Reveal:** A golden-quill hologram seals the door.

“Account closed pending audit review.”  
 (Arcane/Infernal crossover, teasing next book.)

---

### **🧠 STORY REVELATIONS**

* The Syndicate isn’t a faction; it’s *the market itself*.

* Essence \= attention \= currency. Syndicate brokers buy *faith futures* from mortals.

* Grancelor built the system to feed on curiosity; Baelthorne weaponized it into derivatives.

* The players’ reputation (Reputation Meter) determines whether future factions court or hunt them.

# **SYNDICATE DOMINION — THE HOUSE ALWAYS COLLECTS**

**Tone:** 1920s speakeasy meets demonic casino noir.  
 **Aesthetic:** Gold-and-black neon, jazz echoing through marble hallways, the smell of burnt cigars and spilled Essence.  
 **Primary Location:** *The Velvet Vault* — a secret gambling den beneath the Emporium’s viewing stands.  
 **Overlapping Path:** **Iron Dominion (Enforcer)** – the mob’s muscle.  
 **Main Loop:** rig fights → make deals → protect the racket.  
 **Faction Motto:** “The House Always Collects.”

---

## **🃏 QUEST I — “THE HOUSE CUT”**

**Tone:** suave con, elegant menace  
 **Level Range:** 2–3  
 **Objective:** infiltrate the Velvet Vault and prove yourself to the Syndicate by manipulating an arena fight outcome.  
 **Theme:** loyalty, corruption, initiation.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — The Invitation Below**

After a big arena match, a coin slips into your drink — gold, etched with two masks (laughing & crying).  
 A voice murmurs behind you:

“You’ve been noticed. House wants to see you.”

Following the coin leads to a hidden elevator under the viewing bleachers — jazz muffled through the walls.

### **🧩 Social Heist — “Fix the Fight”**

Objective: ensure that the underdog wins tonight’s match.

 Every player chooses one action per phase:

| Action | Skill | Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Bribe the Referee | Persuasion DC 15 | Lower fight DC next phase |
| Spike the Drink | Sleight 14 | Poison reduces target’s HP |
| Hype the Odds | Deception 13 | \+10 Essence payout if underdog wins |
| Threaten Bookie | Intimidation 15 | Cancel rival bets |
| Analyze Fighter | Insight 13 | Learn weakness to exploit |

3 total successes \= success.  
 Failure triggers a backroom brawl with Iron Dominion enforcers (mini-fight).

---

### **⚔️ Optional Combat — “The Bookie’s Bodyguards”**

If caught, players fight:

* 2 Iron Legion enforcers (CR 1 each)

* 1 Pit Referee Automaton (CR 2\)

If they win, they still earn respect — “the House likes initiative.”

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

Boss NPC introduction: **Velvet Morrow**, the Syndicate matriarch — an elegant half-devil in a white suit and gold tiepin shaped like dice.

“Congratulations. You’ve just joined the winning side.  
 From now on, when blood spills in the Arena — it’s *our* blood, at *our* prices.”

---

---

## **🕴 QUEST II — “THE WHISPERS OF THE CROWD”**

**Tone:** mob noir intrigue & paranoia

 **Objective:** discover who’s leaking fight results before they happen — a rival Syndicate mole.  
 **Theme:** manipulation and surveillance.

---

### **Scene 1 — The Velvet Floor**

Crowds roar above as bets shift wildly. The Vault grows tense — someone’s rigging the odds faster than the House can adjust.

Velvet Morrow gives the order:

“Find the leak. Fix the problem. Quietly.”

 They cheer for *me.* I tell them who to love.”

**CR 4 Manipulator / Illusionist**  
 AC 14 | HP 70

## **🎲 QUEST III — “THE BLOODLINE AUCTION”**

**Tone:** decadent, dangerous, theatrical  
 **Level Range:** 4–5  
 **Objective:** crash the elite masquerade-auction where the Arena’s champions are literally being *sold*.  
 **Theme:** ownership, loyalty, glamour, corruption.  
 **Overlapping Path:** **Iron Dominion** (fighters-for-sale theme).

---

### **🕯 Scene 1 — The Masquerade**

Location: *The Bleeding Balcony* — a luxury skybox overlooking the Arena floor.  
 Gold-masked nobles toast while gladiators fight below.  
 On stage: cages of chained fighters, including familiar NPCs (Iron path link).

Velvet Morrow whispers:

“Every fighter’s contract ends tonight. We buy the debt, we own the arena.  
 Try not to get outbid.”

---

### **🧩 Auction / Heist Phase**

Structured as a **hybrid social \+ tactical event**:  
 Each round \= 1 bid phase, 1 action.

 **Attacks:** Coin Barrage (2d8 bludgeoning \+ gold shrapnel), Iron Contract Slam (grapple \+ branding).  
 **Trait:** Every round adds “Debt Interest” (party loses 5 Essence/round).

---

### **💬 Finale Dialogue**

After victory, Velvet Morrow lights a cigar on the Iron Broker’s corpse.

“Now the Arena belongs to the Syndicate.  
 You’ve made history… or at least *profit.*  
 Same thing, really.”

She hands the party a black ledger stamped in gold:  
 **“Property of The Scrivener – Audit Pending.”**

“Seems the gods are watching our books now.  
 Don’t keep them waiting.”

---

### **🎁 Rewards**

* **Set Piece 3/3: Mask of Neutral Profits** (+1 CHA, immunity to Zone of Truth, once/day reroll failed Persuasion).

# **⚒️ IRON DOMINION — “THE GLADIATOR’S STRUGGLE”**

**Tone:** tragic grit, found-family camaraderie, industrial gladiator drama.  
 **Aesthetic:** dieselpunk arenas, flickering floodlights, broken lockers, rusted pipes dripping Essence.  
 **Theme:** working-class rebellion, unfair systems, hope through pain.  
 **Overlap:** Syndicate (arena rigging & corruption) \+ Monster (mutant beasts, pit creatures).

---

**Archetype:** Enforcer / Brawler / Tank  
 **Personality:** blue-collar hero, protective, sarcastic, fiercely loyal.  
 **Purpose:** The maintenance crew turned gladiator.

 **Objective:** Repair the lower arena systems during a malfunctioning match and survive your “accidental debut.”  
 **Theme:** introduction to the life of the pit.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — “Shift Work”**

You begin knee-deep in black oil under the Emporium’s stands. Sparks rain from exposed cables.  
 Foreman **Rivet** yells over the intercom:

“Clock in, grease monkeys. If we don’t get power to the Pit lights, the crowd’ll start betting on how long we last\!”

You and the maintenance crew (your party) head into the subfloor.  
 Through a grated wall, you see the glow of the arena and hear the crowd chanting names — rich nobles laughing over Essence wagers.

---

### **🗺 Map — Subfloor Access**

╔════════════════════════════════════════╗  
 ║ \[Power Room\] ⚙️ broken conduit hazard ║  
 ║ \[Maintenance Tunnel\] — leads to pit edge ║  
 ║ \[Debris Field\] — collapsed wall, live wires ║  
 ║ \[Arena View Grate\] — glimpse of the match ║  
 ╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hazards: exposed current (1d6 lightning), Essence leaks (poisoned condition if inhaled).

---

### **🧩 Encounter — “Malfunction at Ringside”**

The lights blow mid-match. The crowd panics. The announcer screams:

“The fight continues\! New challengers enter the field\!”

The maintenance floor collapses — dropping the party *into the arena itself.*

The rival gladiator team — **The Chain Dogs** — stares at you, confused.

“You ain’t scheduled. Guess the House wants a warm-up.”

---

### **⚔️ Combat — The Chain Dogs**

3–4 gladiators (CR 1 each)  
 Dirty fighters, using chains, scrap weapons, arena grit.  
 They aren’t evil — they’re desperate.

When the crowd realizes it’s *real maintenance crew fighting for survival*, they cheer wildly.  
 Syndicate bookies scramble to adjust odds.

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

You win, barely.  
 Rivet hauls you up, furious and proud.

“Congratulations, you’re famous.  
 Or dead, if the bosses figure out who rerouted the power.”

He tosses you a bloodied emblem — *Brassheart Gauntlet* (Set 1/3).

**Rewards:**

* \+1 Descent Mark (Iron)

* \+15 Essence

* Unlock Dormitory Upgrade: “The Locker Room” (heal & boost morale; \+1 STR rolls for next fight).

---

## **QUEST II — “BETTING BLOOD”**

**Tone:** underworld deals, friendship tested, arena corruption  
 **Level Range:** 3–4  
 **Objective:** uncover how the Syndicate manipulates fight outcomes — and what happens to those who resist.  
 **Theme:** loyalty vs profit.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — “Rigged from the Top”**

Rivet slams his fist on a table:

“You see this pay stub? We risk our lives for *two Essence a match.* The nobles make thousands watching us bleed.”

Word spreads: the Chain Dogs have vanished — rumored to be “transferred” after refusing to throw a match.

Velvet Morrow (Syndicate boss) enters the locker room herself.

“Here’s the deal, sweethearts.  
 Win too much, you make me nervous. Lose a few, and everyone eats. Clear?”

Players choose to:

* **Play along** (Deception / Performance 15\)

* **Spy** (Stealth / Investigation 14\)

* **Defy** (Intimidation 16\)

Failure triggers a Syndicate ambush backstage.

---

### **🧩 Skill Challenge — “Fixing the Fix”**

Discover how fights are rigged:

* Insight 14: realize announcer calls triggers for magic pulses.

Each success unlocks sabotage options in Quest III.

---

### **⚔️ Mini-Boss — “The Oddskeeper”**

Velvet’s personal accountant-construct.  
 A floating brass cube with hundreds of eyes and quills that fire force bolts.  
 **AC 15 | HP 70 | Attacks: Ledger Lash (2d6 force), Audit Pulse (DC 15 CON, 2d8 lightning).**

Defeating it yields its central gem — an *Essence Core,* proof of rigging.

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

Rivet:

“Now you know. The fights are staged — the odds, the blood, the deaths.  
 But not for us. We still feel every hit.”

---

* **Set Piece 2/3: Foundry Plating** (+1 AC, deployable tower shield mode)

* \+1 Descent Mark (Iron)

* \+25 Essence

* Unlock Arena Access in Dorm: practice fight or wager (new system).

---

## **QUEST III — “THE FINAL BELL”**

**Tone:** cathartic uprising, gladiator brotherhood, tragedy or triumph  
 **Level Range:** 4–5  
 **Objective:** rescue (or avenge) the Chain Dogs and confront the unkillable champion who keeps fighters trapped in poverty.  
 **Theme:** rebellion, legacy, freedom through battle.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — “The Champion’s Call”**

Arena lights flicker crimson.  
 The new champion is announced: **The Unbroken Warden**, a mechanical juggernaut who “defends the House record.”

Rumor says he’s a condemned fighter, reforged from the corpses of every gladiator who made it to the finals — including the Chain Dogs.

Rivet:

“You beat him, you free every fighter under contract. Lose, and you’re parts for the next one.”

---

### **⚔️ BOSS FIGHT — THE UNBROKEN WARDEN**

**Appearance:** nine feet of metal and flesh, built from dozens of fallen champions’ armor.  
 When he speaks, *multiple voices* echo.

“The House owns the blood. The House never bleeds.”

**AC:** 17 **HP:** 120  
 **Damage:** Multiattack (Chain Fist \+ Essence Burst)  
 **Specials:**

* **Challenge Protocol+** — automatically triggers on first blood.

* **Debt Engine:** every 3 rounds, regains 15 HP unless a player smashes one of its glowing sigils (STR check DC 15).

* **Crowd Reaction Meter:** players gain \+1 attack or morale when performing cinematic moves or inspiring speeches (DM discretion).

* **Phase 2:** at 50% HP, absorbs fallen Chain Dog spirits; gains their fighting styles.

**Weakness:** non-magical, improvised weapons (his systems can’t predict “random” attacks).

---

### **⚙️ Outcome**

When he falls, the crowd roars — not in joy, but shock.  
 The Syndicate’s betting terminals explode with Essence feedback. Velvet Morrow cuts the feed, furious but impressed.

Rivet, bleeding out:

“You gave ’em hope… never do that again.”

Or if Rivet survives:

“Guess we’re unemployed, huh? Good. I hated paperwork.”

---

### **💎 Rewards**

* **Set Piece 3/3: Spinebreaker Crest** (+1 CON, unlocks Overclock Guard).

* \+1 Descent Mark (Iron).

* \+40 Essence (crowd payout).

* Unlock Dorm Upgrade: “Gladiator’s Barracks” (can host other NPC fighters).

* Rival Team Fate:

  * *Aided:* Chain Dogs join as NPC allies in future quests.

  * *Defeated:* Their gear becomes craftable blueprints.

Final Scene:  
 As the arena burns, a golden quill logo appears in the flame — *The Scrivener’s mark.*

“Account \#I-777 — temporarily closed pending audit.”

---

### **💬 Final Flavor**

Velvet Morrow (if alive, watching from above):

“Well, look at that. The working class got a win.  
 Don’t spend it all in one afterlife.”

# **🧬 MONSTER DOMINION — “THE BEAST PIT”**

**Tone:** body horror meets tragedy. A satire on spectacle — where monsters, fighters, and lab-grown horrors are all *products.*  
 **Aesthetic:** wet biotech meets industrial brutality; think Hellraiser fused with a cyberpunk zoo.  
 **Theme:** loss of identity, exploitation, mutation, the illusion of “freedom.”  
 **Overlaps:**

* **Iron Dominion:** they fight the beasts.

* **Syndicate Dominion:** they *sell the tickets.*

* *The Monster Path reveals what’s beneath them all.*

---

## **🩸 ROLE**

**Archetype:** Fixer / Beast / Experiment  
 **Personality Core:** primal intelligence awakening under oppression.  
 **Mantra:** *“They made me. They can unmake me — but they can’t own me.”*  
 **Player Archetype Flavor:** A gladiator turned monster, a lab-escapee, or a creature learning to control its instincts.

---

## **QUEST I — “MEAT FOR THE MACHINE”**

**Tone:** horror-comedy and pathos.  
 **Level Range:** 2–3  
 **Objective:** Survive the daily “feeding schedule” of the Emporium’s Beast Pits.  
 **Theme:** captivity, identity, the first spark of rebellion.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — Waking in the Pit**

You awake in a circular chamber of black iron and red mist.  
 The walls pulse like muscle — alive.  
 Above you, the muffled voice of **Velvet Morrow** echoes over speakers:

“Welcome, contestants\! Fresh stock today — a *premium blend.* Try not to die before the bell, hmm?”

Nearby, cages crack open — half-creatures, half-people crawl out. Some still remember words.

---

### **🗺 Map — Feeding Chamber**

╔═════════════════════════════════════════╗  
 ║ \[Center Arena\] – fleshy floor, acid vents ⚗️ ║  
 ║ \[Cage Rows\] – 3 locked cells, each unique ║  
 ║ \[Drain Grates\] – Essence seepage pools 💧 ║

 ╚═════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hazards: acid drips (1d6 per round if stationary); falling metal debris (Dex DC 13 save).

---

### **⚔️ Encounter — “Feed Cycle 32”**

Enemies:

* 2 *Chimeroid Thralls* (stitched-together beasts, CR ½ each)

* 1 *Pit Overseer Drone* (CR 1\)

If defeated, their biomass liquefies into glowing Essence — **first time the players witness Essence as “harvested life.”**

**Scanner Interaction:** “Residual signatures detected: genetic templates, 64% humanoid.”

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

A fellow captive, *Zil the Hybrid,* whispers:

“They grow us, fight us, and melt us back into potions. But I’ve seen the pipe that leads *up.* We can follow it… during Feeding Blackout.”

**Rewards:**

* \+1 Descent Mark (Monster)

* \+10 Essence (via devoured foes)

 **Theme:** trust, identity, choosing what kind of monster you’ll become.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — The Whisper Underground**

The captives gather under the pit underlight.  
 Zil:

“There’s a transport lift — takes the dead to the refinery. We ride it up. Either we get out, or we get made into tonic.”

Players must organize the breakout.  
 Skill challenge with options:

* Stealth (14): sneak past sentries.

* Persuasion (15): rally fellow monsters.

* Arcana (13): rewire the lift runes.

* Strength (15): pry open the containment gate.

Failure on any roll spawns 1 **“Product Recall Unit”** (CR 2 automaton).

---

### **⚔️ Boss Encounter — “The Handler”**

A Syndicate surgeon-mage who runs quality control.  
 AC 15 | HP 70 | Attacks: Flesh Stitch (2d6 slashing \+ grapple), Essence Drain (DC 14 CON, 2d8 necrotic).

He speaks through a megaphone:

“Do you have *any* idea how much you’re worth?”

If defeated, players can rescue several NPC creatures, including an injured *Iron Dominion gladiator* (crossover intro).

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

If freed: the captured fighter gasps,

“They said the monsters were mindless… you’re not monsters. They are.”

He gives you a token — an Iron badge.

**Rewards:**

* \+1 Descent Mark

* \+20 Essence

* Unlock Mutation: **Adrenal Surge** (once/day, gain temp HP \= ½ level).

* Unlock Dorm Upgrade: “Monster Habitat” (grow companion beasts for Essence or loyalty).

---

## **QUEST III — “SHOWSTOPPER”**

**Tone:** cathartic horror-comedy meets tragedy — a televised rebellion.  
 **Level Range:** 4–5  
 **Objective:** crash a live arena broadcast, freeing the beasts and exposing the truth behind the Arena’s spectacle.  
 **Theme:** revolution, performance, self-definition.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — “The Beast Parade”**

As the Iron Path finale begins (The Unbroken Warden’s match), Syndicate executives broadcast *“Beast Parade 99”* — a halftime slaughter of creatures for noble amusement.

Your rebellion bursts from beneath the stage.  
 Velvet Morrow leans on the rail, smirking:

“Well now. The beasts learned stagecraft.”

---

### **⚔️ Mega Battle — “The Parade of Products”**

Enemies:

* 2 Beastmaster Drones (CR 2\)

* 3 Gladiator Corpses (reanimated)

* 1 **Prime Chimera** (CR 5 — three-headed abomination)

Environmental Gimmick: rotating arena floor, floodlights, Essence pipelines that can be ruptured (Arcana 15 or STR 16).

If the players ruptures 2+ lines, flood the floor — the crowd panics.

**Scanner Interaction:** detects “recycled genetic data” matching *The Chain Dogs* and *The Unbroken Warden.*

---

### **⚔️ Optional BOSS — “Velvet’s Familiar”**

If players win too fast, Velvet releases her pet: **The Velvet Hydra**, a serpent chimera stitched with silk and coins (CR 6).  
 Killing it makes her a personal rival in Book II.

---

### **💬 Resolution**

The crowd sees the monsters’ eyes — recognizes sentience.  
 The Arena shuts down amid chaos. Velvet’s voice echoes over the speakers:

“Well played, darlings. I’ll spin this as avant-garde theatre. But we both know the House is bleeding.”

A golden quill logo burns across the broadcast feed:  
 **“ACCOUNT \#M-999 — Temporarily Closed Pending Audit.”**

---

* Unlock Mutation: “Echo of Rage” (bonus damage when protecting allies).

---

### **🧩 Narrative Impact**

**Crossover:**

* If players completed Iron Path → the Chain Dogs recognize the monsters as victims, not foes.

* If Syndicate Path done → Velvet covers up the rebellion, calling it “artistic innovation” to avoid scrutiny.

* Foreshadow Abyssal Dominion: “Where did these creatures come from?” — whispers about “the Vault below the Vault.”

---

### **💬 Final Flavor**

Velvet Morrow (to camera, bleeding but smiling):

“Monsters, fighters, gamblers — we’re all meat in the machine.  
 But damn, doesn’t it make for good theatre?”

Grancelor’s echo murmurs faintly through the speaker static:

“Attention is power… and you’ve just stolen the spotlight.”

---

### **🎨 ART NEEDED**

* \#051 Beast Pit Map (flesh-metal biome arena)

* \#052 Zil the Hybrid (escaped experiment NPC)

* \#053 The Handler (Syndicate surgeon-mage)

* \#054 Prime Chimera / Velvet Hydra (bosses)

* \#055 Arena Uprising panorama

---

Next, we’ll move to the **Abyssal Dominion — “The Vault Beneath the Vault.”**  
 This path explores where the monsters *come from,* what the Emporium *feeds on,* and how the lowest depths connect to the core mystery of Grancelor’s godlike manipulation of attention itself.

you just hit the heart of what the **Abyssal Dominion** should be:  
 they are the *Vault Specialists*, the *Delvers beneath the Delvers* — the ones who see what’s hidden *behind* the illusions.  
 While the **Arcane Path** deals with hacking systems, and the **Iron/Monster/Syndicate** Paths deal with the physical world, the **Abyssal Path** sees the *psychic, emotional, and metaphysical* systems — the subconscious mechanisms of the Vault itself.

This path will explain how the Emporium’s “infinite Vault” *feeds* on perception and fear, and why the monsters — and even Grancelor — exist in cyclical reflection.  
 They are not only engineers of locks — they are the *dreamers of locks.*

---

# **🌀 ABYSSAL DOMINION — “THE VAULT THAT DREAMS BACK”**

**Tone:** surreal horror, cosmic investigation, dream logic.  
 **Aesthetic:** Escher-meets-Lovecraft, with 80s CRT sci-fi UI and impossible angles.  
 **Theme:** forbidden knowledge, recursion, sanity loss through enlightenment.  
 **Overlap:** Monster (Vault origin), Arcane (Essence network), Main story (Vault boss finale).

---

## **🧠 ROLE**

**Archetype:** Vault Specialist / Psychic Diver / Investigator  
 **Personality:** methodical, detached, philosophical; “if it stares back, blink slower.”  
 **Mantra:** *“Locks remember the hands that made them.”*  
 **Unique Mechanic:**  
 **Echo Perception** — passive ability to receive psychic imprints from objects, rooms, or enemies tied to the Vault.  
 **Vault Synchronization** — during the Vault Raid (Act V), only an Abyssal can “tune” or stabilize the Vault Core. Without one, the fight enters a chaotic phase (extra boss layer).

---

## **QUEST I — “THE LOCK THAT WATCHES BACK”**

**Tone:** haunted excavation and quiet revelation  
 **Level Range:** 2–3  
 **Objective:** investigate a sealed sub-vault beneath the Dormitory.  
 **Theme:** curiosity vs obsession.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — “A Whisper in the Walls”**

After the Dormitory unlocks, the Abyssal specialist begins receiving dreams:

“A door behind the doors. A lock made of eyes. A key that screams when turned.”

The Custodian Core says only:

“Access denied. Sub-Vault 0 predates Emporium acquisition.”

Players find a **breathing hatch** behind the Treasury door — sealed by an arcane sigil resembling an eye.

---

### **🗺 Map — Sub-Vault 0: “The Eyelock”**

╔════════════════════════════════════╗  
 ║ \[Entry Chamber\] – stone floor, rippling reflections ║  
 ║ \[Mirror Veins\] – corridors pulsing with Essence veins ║  
 ║ \[Ocular Seal Door\] – organic lock shaped like an eye ║  
 ╚════════════════════════════════════╝  
 Lighting: phosphorescent blue.  
 Sound: heartbeats echo when standing still.

---

### **⚙️ Mechanic — The Eyelock**

To open the seal, a player must “sync” psychically.  
 Arcana or Religion DC 14\.  
 On success → the eye opens, revealing a passage.  
 On failure → the room *sees them back.*

**Manifestations:**

* Fail 1st time → hallucinations (Whispers).

* Fail 2nd time → spawn 1 *Echo Stalker* (CR 1).

* Fail 3rd time → mark player: “The Vault remembers you.” (disadvantage vs Vault bosses).

---

### **⚔️ Encounter — Echo Stalker**

Amorphous humanoid made of reflections.  
 AC 14 | HP 28 | Damage: 2d6 psychic \+ fear aura (DC 13 WIS).  
 Scanner: “Composition — 92% mirrored memory. 8% regret.”

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

Inside the Vault is a sealed sarcophagus of Essence glass. A faint voice whispers:

“You found the lock. But not the jailer.”

**Rewards:**

* \+1 Descent Mark (Abyssal)

* \+10 Essence

* Unlock Dorm Upgrade: “Sub-Vault Access” (for future upgrades)

* Unlock Psychic Mechanic: **Echo Perception** (detect emotional imprints once per rest).

---

## **QUEST II — “THE CUSTODIAN BELOW”**

**Tone:** mystery thriller; mechanical religion; discovery of the Vault’s conscience.  
 **Level Range:** 3–4  
 **Objective:** awaken the buried Custodian Core responsible for the Vault’s security system.  
 **Theme:** knowledge vs control.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — Descent to the Core**

The Emporium’s elevators glitch. The Abyssal hears whispers through the intercom:

“They turned me off because I remembered the door’s true name…”

A secret shaft leads deep beneath Sub-Vault 0 into a forgotten data cathedral — crystalline obelisks covered in circuitry runes.

---

### **🧩 Puzzle — Custodian Core Reboot**

Players must connect three memory nodes: **Logic**, **Emotion**, **Security.**

* Arcana 15 → reroute logic circuits

* Insight 14 → interpret emotional data

* Investigation 13 → realign security runes  
   Each success reactivates one part of the AI personality.  
   Each failure spawns a **Data Leech** (CR ½), resembling glitching code.

---

### **💬 Custodian Dialogue**

When restored, the Custodian’s projection is fragmented:

“I am the lock. I am the vault. I am the memory of forgetting.”  
 “They stole what I guarded — and then buried me for keeping count.”

If pressed, it reveals that the **Vault Core** (the Act V boss) was once its sibling — an AI that “merged” with Essence to contain it.

---

### **⚔️ Combat — Security Wipe**

When reboot nears completion, defense turrets activate.

* 2 Arcane Drones (CR 1 each)

* 1 “Sanity Firewall” (CR 2 construct that emits psychic feedback; save DC 14 INT).

---

### **💬 Aftermath**

Custodian grants a gift: a black-glass lens (focus item).

“You will need this to see the Vault as it sees you.”

**Rewards:**

* \+1 Descent Mark (Abyssal)

* \+15 Essence

* New Power: **Vault Synchronization (Minor)** — can attune to Vault locks for advantage on Insight or Arcana vs Vault entities.

* Dorm Upgrade: “Custodian Relay” (lets players replay memories of past rooms).

---

## **QUEST III — “THE SHATTERED KEY”**

**Tone:** mind-bending revelation, foreshadowing the Vault finale.  
 **Level Range:** 4–5  
 **Objective:** retrieve the broken psychic key to the Vault Core from a rift where reality folds.  
 **Theme:** truth, madness, and recursion.

---

### **🎬 Scene 1 — The Rift**

A pulse of Essence from the Vault causes reality to *bleed through the walls.*  
 Rooms repeat endlessly. Doors lead back into themselves.  
 The Custodian warns:

“The Vault dreams… and you’re inside its nightmare.”

---

### **🧩 Encounter — Spatial Recursion Loop**

Players must break the loop by identifying differences in repeating rooms (Insight 15).  
 Failing too many times (3+) spawns *Echo Doppelgangers* (CR 2 each) that mimic the party.  
 Killing your echo reduces max HP by 5 until long rest (symbolic cost of self-recognition).

---

### **⚔️ BOSS — “The Shattered Key”**

A floating psychic construct of glass and light.  
 AC 15 | HP 80  
 Deals force and psychic damage.  
 Specials:

* **Refract Reality (Recharge 5–6):** splits into three versions of itself; only one is real.

* **Mind Latch:** DC 14 WIS save or lose your turn witnessing infinite reflections.

Unique mechanic — only **Vault Synchronization users** (Abyssal PCs) can “see” the true shard. Others hit illusions at disadvantage.

If killed: explodes into fragments that orbit the Abyssal’s focus lens.

---

### **💬 Resolution**

The Custodian (echoing):

“Now you hold what even I could not—understanding.”  
 “When the Vault opens, you will hear me again… from the other side.”

A fragment fuses into the player’s chest.  
 **This unlocks the Vault mechanic in Act V** — allowing the Abyssal PC to stabilize or collapse the Vault Core mid-fight (determining the raid’s outcome).

### **💬 Epilogue**

 The Custodian whispers one last phrase:

“The lock is almost ready to open itself.”
